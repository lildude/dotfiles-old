# Welcome to Atom!

1. To help us improve Atom, we anonymously track usage metrics. See the
   [atom/metrics](https://github.com/atom/metrics) package for details on what
   information is tracked and for instructions on how to disable it.

2. If you only remember one thing make it `cmd-shift-P`. This keystroke toggles
   the command palette, which lists every Atom command. Yes, you can try it now!
   Press `cmd-shift-P`, type `markdown` and press enter. It will trigger the
   `markdown-preview:show` command which renders this text to HTML.

3. Here is where you can get more help with Atom

   * The [Atom docs](https://www.atom.io/docs) contain Guides and the API
     reference.
   * Discuss Atom at [discuss.atom.io](http://discuss.atom.io).
   * The [Atom Org](https://github.com/atom). This is where all GitHub created Atom
     packages can be found.

4. If you ever want to see this buffer again use the command palette
   (`cmd-shift-P`) and search for `Welcome`.
