Along with most other runners, I arrived with great aspirations of a massive PB and my own goal of running sub-2:45. Boy was I wrong to think this was possible on my first attempt at London.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- more --&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I had such great success at the &lt;a href=&quot;/race-report-abingdon-marathon-2013/&quot;&gt;Abingdon Marathon back in 2013&lt;/a&gt; I stuck to using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hansons-Marathon-Method-Renegade-ebook/dp/B00AWE9686/&quot;&gt;Hansons Marathon Method&lt;/a&gt; for this race, but with a much more ambitious target pace.  With four months of great training and a few fast build up half-marathons under my belt I arrived at the &amp;quot;Fast Good for Age&amp;quot; start area, right at the front of the red start, with plenty of time and confident in my ability to run a great race and dip under 2:45.  The cool overcast and almost windless conditions added to this confidence - it was perfect marathon racing conditions for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 10:10 the fog horn went and we were off.  The race started with a bit of meandering through the suburbs with a relatively thin stream of spectators cheering us on. Keeping to my desired pace was easy here.  At about 4km the crowds started to noticeably thicken and by 5km when the red and blue/green fields merged the crowds were thunderous and incredibly motivating.  I knew there would be a lot of spectators along the route, but I didn&amp;#39;t expect them to start so soon into the race and be so excited, numerous and motivating. Other than a few areas around The Isle of Dogs, most of the route was at least two to three people deep on each side of the road.  Tower Bridge is particularly amazing and motivating... and deafeningly loud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This proved to be my downfall.  I got so caught up in the cheering from the crowds and the whole exciting atmosphere that I found myself arriving at half-way nearly 3 minutes ahead of schedule and as we all know, starting too fast will never end well, and that&amp;#39;s precisely what happened to me.  Just after the 32k mark the wheels started to come off and my pace dropped dramatically. I had a particularly terrible section through Canary Wharf but thanks to the immense crowds I held on and came out of the slump and managed to finish in a respectable time of &lt;a href=&quot;http://results-2015.virginmoneylondonmarathon.com/2015/?content=detail&amp;amp;fpid=search&amp;amp;pid=search&amp;amp;idp=9999990F5ECC830000171419&amp;amp;lang=EN_CAP&amp;amp;event=MAS&amp;amp;search%5Bname%5D=Seymour&amp;amp;search%5Bfirstname%5D=Colin&amp;amp;search%5Bsex%5D=%25&amp;amp;search%5Bnation%5D=%25&amp;amp;search_sort=name&amp;amp;search_event=MAS&quot;&gt;2:53:34&lt;/a&gt; - a 16 second PB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The little &amp;quot;Over final 7.2k&amp;quot; box in the bottom right of this image gives you an idea of how much I slowed:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/vlm-runpix.png&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;656&quot; height=&quot;635&quot; alt=&quot;VLM runpix&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally I&amp;#39;m the one doing the overtaking, not being overtaken. 247 people passing me isn&amp;#39;t a lot in the grand scheme of things, but it does equate to nearly 25% of the people who finished ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The London Marathon was a brilliant experience and a race I&amp;#39;ll definitely be doing again. I&amp;#39;m really pleased to have run this race and experienced it and more so because, despite the wheels coming a bit loose, I still managed a personal best.  My finishing time qualifies me for a &amp;quot;Good for Age&amp;quot; entry again next year, but I think I might give it a miss and try a different and smaller race.  We&amp;#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now to find a fast autumn marathon in which I won&amp;#39;t get distracted by the crowds so I can have a good go at that sub-2:45 goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">The World&#39;s Fastest Recreational Runners</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/the-worlds-fastest-recreational-runners\"/>\n   <updated>2015-04-24T09:17:44+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/the-worlds-fastest-recreational-runners</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/the-worlds-fastest-everyday-runners/&quot;&gt;this interesting article&lt;/a&gt; from the New York Times which links to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://runrepeat.com/research-marathon-performance-across-nations&quot;&gt;analysis performed by Danish statisticians&lt;/a&gt; on the non-elite finishers of the Amsterdam, Athens, Berlin, Boston, Budapest, Chicago, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Marine Corps (Washington), Paris and Warsaw marathons, between 2009 and 2014, and then determined which were the fastest nations by average finishing time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is interesting idea and the New York Times article opens with:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A new analysis of more than a million recreational marathon participants at major marathons around the world finds that the world’s swiftest amateur marathoners do not share the same nationalities as the world’s elite racers, many of whom come from East Africa. In terms of average pace for its runners, the United States sits near the bottom of the nations included, vastly trailing that marathon powerhouse, Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... and towards the end quotes one of the statisticians with ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Many see Africa as the marathon continent, but they only dominate in the elite scene,&amp;quot; says Jens Jakob Andersen, a runner and statistician in Haderslev, Denmark, and the lead researcher for the new analysis. &amp;quot;In recreational running, it is not a popular sport.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... and by looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://runrepeat.com/research-marathon-performance-across-nations&quot;&gt;infographic and analysis&lt;/a&gt;, they&amp;#39;re right:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://runrepeat.com/research-marathon-performance-across-nations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/RunRepeat-Graphic.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Truncated infographic&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... however, as I see it, the data isn&amp;#39;t really representative of the world as a whole and as such doesn&amp;#39;t fully support the comments and conclusions made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;So what&amp;#39;s wrong with the analysis?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; you may ask. Well, two things instantly pop to mind:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The races analysed are not spread out across the world&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst the analysis has been performed on some of the largest and most popular marathons in the world, they&amp;#39;re mostly concentrated in Europe with a few from the US. Not a single African, Asian or Asia-Pacific race has been included in their analysis thus skewing the results.  This is particularly pertinent as it is considerably more expensive to travel from Africa, Asia or Asia-Pacific to Europe and the US than it is to travel in-and-around Europe or from Europe to the US and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Performing a similar analysis of just marathons in Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand would lead to heavy weighting towards nations on that side of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationality of competitors probably isn&amp;#39;t logged for local runners&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my experience, races only register the nationality of runners if they enter via the international registration process. This leaves out all those who may be living temporarily or permanently in the country of the race in question but still identify themselves as being from another country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These two points dramatically cut down on the diversity of the results and limits entries from African, Asian and Asia-Pacific countries to those that are wealthy enough or who have been sponsored to travel to the countries of the races studied.  To me these points also significantly water down and possibly invalidate the claims being made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also not clear what they classify as an &amp;quot;elite&amp;quot; runner. I run sub-3 hours but don&amp;#39;t consider myself elite... far from it.  By London Marathon standards I don&amp;#39;t even qualify for the championship start which is for the super-fast club runners.  I doubt this will affect the results much, but it would have been nice to know this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to see this analysis performed again using a number of races with similar sized fields from many more countries and then see how this compares to the elite performances.  I suspect we&amp;#39;ll see African and Asian countries ranking much higher than they do here.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">What&#39;s Wrong with Free?</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/whats-wrong-with-free\"/>\n   <updated>2015-04-18T04:08:10+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/whats-wrong-with-free</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Once again I find myself in San Francisco for work and I realised the American distrust for free extends to running too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Sunday morning I went for my last long run before the London Marathon and ran the length of the Embarcadero. I like the route as it&amp;#39;s nice and flat, except for the big hill round Fort Mason, and has great views of the bridge and Alcatraz. It&amp;#39;s also a great sunny route so I can top-up on my vitamin D at the same time. Anyway, my run was cut short because of an event starting and finishing at Crissy Field, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://guardsmen.org/presidio10/race-info.html&quot;&gt;Presidio 10 Mile/10KM/5KM&lt;/a&gt;.  I knew this event was on but chose not to enter any of them as a) I didn&amp;#39;t want to tempt fate by racing so close to London, b) I had other plans for a long run already scheduled and c) I objected to paying what I consider an exorbitant entry fee. And it&amp;#39;s this last point that I want to come back to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- more --&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 5K race had &lt;a href=&quot;http://results.chronotrack.com/event/results/event/event-13531?lc=en&quot;&gt;727 finishers&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom paid between $35 and $45 to run those 5 kilometers. $35??!! And all they got for their money and time was a T-shirt.  Saturday morning, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.us/crissyfield/&quot;&gt;Crissy Field parkrun&lt;/a&gt;, which takes place in the exact same place, which costs absolutely NOTHING had 19 finishers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the affliction with free?  parkrun is not an inferior product.  Yes, you don&amp;#39;t get a T-shirt and medal after each run, but you do after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.com/about/our-clubs/&quot;&gt;50, 100, 250 etc&lt;/a&gt; but that&amp;#39;s not the point. It&amp;#39;s about getting out and having fun and keeping healthy all for the handsome price of nothing, zip, nada, not a penny. And best of all, officially timed results each and every time.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Strava Labs FlyBy</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/strava-labs-flyby\"/>\n   <updated>2015-02-28T12:09:15+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/strava-labs-flyby</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I discovered another of Strava&amp;#39;s experimental features the other day: &lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.strava.com/flyby/&quot;&gt;FlyBy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what is it? It&amp;#39;s a site that will let you know who you passed or &amp;quot;flew by&amp;quot; while you were out running or riding.  It puts together all the logged runs that crossed or came very close to your uploaded run and then lets you replay your run/ride to see exactly where you passed the other runners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of cool but not really useful, except maybe to learn the name of the rude runner who didn&amp;#39;t wave back on your long run this morning or to stalk the handsome/pretty man/lady who&amp;#39;s derriere you gazed at non-stop for countless hours.  Actually, that&amp;#39;s a pretty good use... now you can work out precisely home long you were looking at her bum &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:&#39; alt=&#39;😜&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f61c.svg&#39;&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another useful feature is I can fire up LICEcap (a terrible gif screen capture tool but pretty good at what it does) and create a gif of today&amp;#39;s Reading parkrun to show you how it went:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/flyby.gif&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;Reading parkrun on FlyBy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m the red one &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure this will become particularly popular but it&amp;#39;s a nice way to kill a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">First Test of London Training</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-test-of-london-training\"/>\n   <updated>2015-02-08T08:28:18+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-test-of-london-training</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;The first test of my London Marathon training is today: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wokinghamhalfmarathon.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Wokingham Half Marathon&lt;/a&gt;.

I went into the year with &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/2013-in-summary/&quot;&gt;so many plans and aspirations&lt;/a&gt; and nothing came of them. Why?  Injury, and right at the beginning of the year too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all began in January. It was a fine sunny morning and I found myself in San Francisco again.  I woke up on the morning of the 21st and headed down to the Embarcadero for my scheduled interval session - 6x 800m with 400m recovery. These turned out to be quite tough due to jetlag and not eating breakfast.  It was however during one of the intervals that I went over on my right ankle.  I thought nothing of it and jogged it off as you normally do.  Things were a little tender on the next few runs but I managed to get through a few easy runs.  Then on the plane home my ankle blew up and the pain set in.  This took me out of running for pretty much the next few months and being the anxious and eager runner I am, I probably attempted to run each time sooner than I really should have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Racing&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result I ended up pulling out of the Shakespeare and Giant&amp;#39;s Head marathons, both of which I&amp;#39;d paid for in advance, and only ran two races, excluding parkruns, all year. I took part in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ragnarrelay.com/race/napavalley/&quot;&gt;Ragnar Napa Valley relay&lt;/a&gt; (reminds me, I still need to finish this post) with eleven of my colleagues and the Bournemouth Marathon, both of which went a lot better than I expected.  The only redeeming thing is the Wokingham half marathon was cancelled due to flooding so I didn&amp;#39;t miss out on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Training&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully my ankle has held out for the last part of the year so I&amp;#39;ve managed to get in quite a bit of training towards the end of the year.  I&amp;#39;ve also worked out what is likely to have caused me going over on my ankle... I&amp;#39;ve worked out that when I run slowly on my easy runs, I have a tendency to over-relax my ankles.  This seems to lead to instability which in turn triggers the pain on the outside of my right leg.  Concentrating on landing on the balls of my feet without overly relaxing my ankles seems to do the trick and has allowed me to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not all doom and gloom though. Thanks to work, I&amp;#39;ve been lucky enough to run several times in San Francisco, including right the way through Golden Gate Park to the ocean and back again and along the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/marin-headlands-are-still-waiting-for-me/&quot;&gt;Coastal Trail from Golden Gate Bridge to Golden Gate Park&lt;/a&gt;, Amsterdam and I also found myself in Vegas so run The Strip from the Wynn hotel right down to the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite not being able to run much in the early part of the year, I have managed to keep living a mostly carb-free life and am still enjoying the benefits and the way I feel.  I definitely notice when I&amp;#39;ve been eating processed carbs, especially sugar, and continue to try and avoid them.  I&amp;#39;m flexible though as it&amp;#39;s not always possible and desired given all the travelling I&amp;#39;ve been doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#39;s on the Cards for 2015?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;London Marathon in under 2:50\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/vlm-2015-youre-in/&quot;&gt;I have a &amp;quot;Good for Age&amp;quot; place&lt;/a&gt; based on my Abingdon Marathon time from 2013 so will be using the first part of the year to build up for it.  A sub-2:45 would be amazing, but given the number of people and the route, I suspect I may not get this so I&amp;#39;ve got another goal of dipping under 2:50.  We&amp;#39;ll see if that happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 parkrun milestone\nThis shouldn&amp;#39;t be too hard to get this year as I&amp;#39;ve only got 3 more to go, but more importantly, I plan to do more parkruns &amp;quot;just as a run&amp;quot; rather than treat them as mini-races or speed sessions like I used to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rally my colleagues to run the Ragnar Napa Relay again\nThis was such a great event that it would be insane not to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:hammer:&#39; alt=&#39;🔨&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f528.svg&#39;&gt; those PBs\nI&amp;#39;m fast approaching 40 so will soon have to accept I&amp;#39;ll never be fast again and will have to settle for &amp;quot;Fast for age PBs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep up the LCHF lifestyle\nThis is proving to be the right thing for me.  The only real change I plan to make is cut down on the beer and drink more cider instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s 2014 in a quick summary.  A very disappointing year for running.  Hopefully 2015 will be much better and a lot more like 2013.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Tricking The Mind to a Sub-2 Hour Marathon</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tricking-the-mind-to-sub-2-hour-marathon\"/>\n   <updated>2014-12-21T13:28:26+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tricking-the-mind-to-sub-2-hour-marathon</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in the process of reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Faster-Higher-Stronger-Generation-Superathletes---ebook/dp/B00INIXN9Q/&quot;&gt;Faster, Higher, Stronger: How Sports Science Is Creating a New Generation of Superathletes--and What We Can Learn from Them by Mark McClusky&lt;/a&gt; - a great read so far - and I&amp;#39;ve just read chapter 8 &amp;quot;What Getting Tired Means&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s a chapter that talks about how science and research has changed the definition of what fatigue is and talks about how it is likely to be more of a mental state than a physical state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It covers Tim Noakes&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_governor&quot;&gt;central governor theory&lt;/a&gt; and how various mental stimuli can be used to reduce the sense of fatigue and how drugs have been known to do the same thing.  One little thing they brought up was the topic of tricking the mind by manipulating a runner&amp;#39;s watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking... how likely are we to get that sub-2 hour marathon if Dennis Kimetto&amp;#39;s (or any other elite athlete) coach/manager and the Berlin marathon race organisers &amp;quot;rigged&amp;quot; things to make Dennis think he&amp;#39;s running slower than he really is?  What if they colluded to make Dennis&amp;#39;s wristwatch and the clock on the lead car to run deliberately fast by a second or two per kilometer?  Would this be enough to drive him to run even quicker and break the two hour mark or would he soon realise something was suss?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an interesting thing to ponder, especially as elite athletes are probably right on the edge of what they can do in terms of physicality without resorting to drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chapter did bring up another topic which intrigues me and which I&amp;#39;m looking into now: &amp;quot;brain endurance training&amp;quot;. The idea is you perform mentally fatiguing exercises before and during training with the aim of reducing mental fatigue and perception of effort whilst racing. The book mentions some pretty amazing and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesportinmind.com/articles/brain-training-improving-performance-from-your-lounge-room-2/&quot;&gt;impressive results from research performed by Samuele Marcora&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the University of Kent, that is definitely worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marcora is apparently working with British Athletic in their preparations for Rio so it&amp;#39;ll be interesting to see how this research pans out over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, I&amp;#39;m off to scour the interwebs and I might start doing tough sudokus before my runs &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Marin Headlands are Still Waiting for Me</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/marin-headlands-are-still-waiting-for-me\"/>\n   <updated>2014-11-09T19:23:15+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/marin-headlands-are-still-waiting-for-me</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I find myself in San Francisco again this week and when planning my trip, booked an AirBnB in Lower Haight so I&amp;#39;d be closer to Golden Gate park and Presidio.  The intent behind this decision was to see what it&amp;#39;s like to &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; in another &amp;#39;hood in San Francisco, but more importantly I had the idea that one of my runs would take me the full length of Golden Gate park so I could wet my feet in the sea and run back again and another would take me through the Presidio, across Golden Gate bridge, up to Marin Headlands (for the obligatory snap of Golden Gate bridge with San Francisco in the background) and back again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I ticked off the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strava.com/activities/216924680&quot;&gt;run the lengths of Golden Gate park, touch the ocean and run back&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; run and this morning I tried the Marin Headlands run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke this morning to the common sight of fog over San Francisco, but as the sun came up, it soon started to burn off so I headed off feeling quite confident it would be all clear by the time I got to Marin Headlands. I was also feeling great after 9 hours of sleep - I hope this is the sleep that broke the jet lag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All was good until I got to the edge of Golden Gate bridge... the footpath was closed until 10:30am for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mermaidseries.com/#!__san-francisco&quot;&gt;Mermaid Series 10 mile race&lt;/a&gt; that was taking place. I thought, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Oooo, maybe they&amp;#39;re allowing pedestrians to use the west side of the bridge during the race&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; - this side is normally only open to cyclists... nope. I got to the west side and was told... &amp;quot;NOPE! Wait until the race is finished at 10:30 or use the shuttle to cross and walk back.&amp;quot;  I got to the bridge just after 8:30 and there was no way I was going to wait 2 hours.  I also decided against using the shuttle to cross and run back as it was still very foggy and didn&amp;#39;t look like it would be clearing any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, I ran the Coastal trail back towards Golden Gate park.  Lovely trail and I&amp;#39;m sure the sights would have been brilliant had it not been for the fog.  All I could see were trees, fog and the path.  I did hear a lot of boats on their horns as they entered the bay which was quite unusual for me.  I also ran past some pretty swish looking houses (some with astroturf front lawns) and got to run a route I&amp;#39;d only planned doing some other time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe height=&#39;405&#39; width=&#39;590&#39; frameborder=&#39;0&#39; allowtransparency=&#39;true&#39; scrolling=&#39;no&#39; src=&#39;https://www.strava.com/activities/217419869/embed/9dddd11c53206613246911d1946aad0279ad966a&#39;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So whilst I&amp;#39;m a little disappointed I couldn&amp;#39;t go the Marin Headlands today, I&amp;#39;m happy I still had a good run on the Coastal Trail and also slightly pleased I didn&amp;#39;t make the effort as I suspect all I would have seen was white.

Whilst in San Francisco in the last week of January I woke up one morning with a slightly tender right ankle. Being the silly arse that I am, I went for a run in the glorious sunshine.  A gentle 2km warm up seemed to loosen things up and I broke into my planned 800m intervals with 600m recovery along the Embarcadero.  This was a great workout, except for the recovery runs... my right ankle really wasn&#39;t too happy with those.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, to cut a long story short, I&#39;ve not really gone much further than about 5km since as my right ankle keeps flaring up.  I suspect it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eorthopod.com/content/peroneal-tendon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;peroneal tendonitis&lt;/a&gt; but I&#39;ve not gone to the doctors yet.  I&#39;ll give it a few more weeks before seeking expert advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in order to stop myself becoming a great big fat lazy oaf and to try and keep some sort of semblance of fitness (and sanity) in the slight hope I might actually get to run enough to actually finish the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shakespearemarathon.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shakespeare Marathon&lt;/a&gt; at the end of April I&#39;ve been cycling, swimming and going to the gym with the gym part being the most boring.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nToday I got this crazy idea (Tom Williams from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marathontalk.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marathon Talk&lt;/a&gt; is also partly to blame as he&#39;s incorporating CrossFit into his training this year) that I could try a few CrossFit exercises in the gym to get a bigger bang for my buck and found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/009141.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Workout of the Day&quot; (WoD):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;WoD 140301&quot; src=&quot;/assets/WoD-140301.png&quot; width=&quot;483&quot; height=&quot;163&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds easy enough, except for the 95lb (approx 43kg) barbell part: there&#39;s no way I can do 5 thrusters at that weight - I can&#39;t get the weight over my head - let alone 45!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you something, I got this so so wrong.  I seriously misjudged this workout.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m by no means a CrossFit expert but I have speed-read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/faq.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; and have a good idea of how to do most of the exercises from my old weightlifting days.  What I wasn&#39;t sure about was if I was meant to do this in &quot;rounds&quot; (ie 21 thrusters followed by 21 pull-ups etc) or in turn.  I thought rounds so that what I had in mind when I went to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Being cautious, I warmed up and then loaded an olympic bar with a massive 10kg - 5kg per side - taking the bar + weights to 30kg and hit my first set of 21 thrusters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;OH MY WORD!!! I nearly keeled over. I got to about 13 reps and was so out of breath I had to pause.  By the time I got to 21 I didn&#39;t have the breath or energy to hoik myself up to the pull-up bar for the pull ups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the end I did the thrusters with loads of rest between sets, then the pull-ups - only to failure - and called it a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I got home I looked up this innocently sounding &quot;Fran&quot; workout and discovered this is one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://crossfitrosslyn.com/fran-tips-for-completing-this-benchmark-workout/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;benchmark CrossFit workouts&lt;/a&gt;. I also discovered I&#39;m allowed, and actually encouraged to &quot;cheat&quot; in the pull-ups - it&#39;s called doing kipping pull-ups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Want to see how this workout is done (nothing like how I did it)?, here you go:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/WoWD5BsENTM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The kipping pull-ups look really odd to me, but I guess the idea it to keep the whole body working and not just the arms and back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got my work cut out for me if I&#39;m ever going to get up to doing these with 90lbs of weight without nearly killing myself. I do however now know this is a great one for measuring my progress and will definitely do this properly soon so I&#39;ve got a benchmark to work from.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">2013 in Summary</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2013-in-summary\"/>\n   <updated>2014-01-14T12:41:00+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2013-in-summary</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m only a month and a half late with this, but as they say, &quot;better late than never&quot; &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So how was 2013 for me in terms of running?  Absolutely bloody brilliant in the end.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Training&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started the year off a little slowly.  The weather wasn&#39;t very good and I wasn&#39;t particularly motivated after working the Christmas period having gotten back from visiting family in South Africa.  What training I was doing was mostly the MAF approach with one session of Yasso 800s a week thrown in... the idea was to try and get a bit more speed in my legs in preparation for my first marathon in nearly 10 years.  This served me well, or so I thought. Blowing up spectacularly in the Milton Keynes marathon proved there was no way I was going to get under three hours on MAF alone... I needed more tough workouts that would teach me to run quicker and longer on tired legs.  So I did a bit of research and discovered the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/marathoning-hansons-way?page=single&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hanson Marathon Method&lt;/a&gt;. This struck a chord with me so I bought the book and I switched to the advanced programme of the Hanson Marathon Method and this proved to be a brilliant programme for me.  My mileage increased, my training more consistent and more importantly tougher and more specific to the demands of racing a sub-3 hour marathon. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All this marathon specific training also saw me tick off the most kilometres of running in a year ever of 3236km with 5 months topping 300km of which September was the highest at a whopping 383km.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Races&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can expect all that training paid off and paid off brilliantly in all distances that I raced. I set new lifetime personal bests in all distances I raced and in some of them by a large margin over the year before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Check out my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/a&gt; page for my personal bests as they now stand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I stuck with the paleo-lite/low-carb-high-fat (LCHF) diet as it is proving to work so well for my running and general health and energy levels.  I&#39;ve not been 100% strict, but pretty consistent and I think its this consistency that has allowed me to adapt and take full advantage of all those fat calories.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;On to 2014&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So what&#39;s on the cards for 2014?  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;More training as I&#39;ve entered three marathons spread across the year with the goal of dipping under 2:50 in the third Unfortunately, the training is on a bit of a go-slow as I write this as I&#39;ve developed a suspected stress fracture in my right ankle which I&#39;m putting down to literally hitting the track too hard: I think I went into track sessions with a little too much gusto.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;More marathons: you&#39;ve got to do them to become good at them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;More strength training.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My 50 parkruns T-shirt.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stick with the LCHF diet and try and reduce the amount of beer I drink - this is my one &quot;sin&quot; under the LCHF diet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set new personal bests in all distances.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things started off so well this year before I hurt my ankle so here&#39;s to hoping it heals quickly and I can get back onto the road and back up to my desired and required training volume soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">First Run of 2014: Done</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-run-of-2014-done\"/>\n   <updated>2014-01-02T13:56:27+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-run-of-2014-done</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;First run of 2014...

It&#39;s golf in which the objective is to finish as quickly as possible with the fewest number of strokes.  Each round takes about an hour to an hour-and-a-half instead of who knows how long.  You could probably cover 3-4 rounds of speed golf and get in a good long interval/fartlek session in the time it takes to do one round of normal golf.  Best thing of all, it&#39;s mostly on lovely plush grass so you could do it entirely barefoot too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/zQ43miMu0lw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I might have a reason to learn to play golf now.

Unlike Thugwane, Le Grange never had the opportunity to compete at the Olympic Games because of the international sports boycott against his country, but he was the first athlete to run a sub-2:20:00 marathon on the continent of Africa and set six South African marathon records – the only runner in history to do so more than twice.&lt;br /&gt;\n— &lt;a href=&quot;http://running.competitor.com/2013/11/news/south-africa-loses-famous-marathoner_89015&quot; title=&quot;South Africa Loses Famous Marathoner - Competitor Running&quot;&gt;South Africa Loses Famous Marathoner - Competitor Running&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d never heard of this chap until this article and I&#39;m very surprised and a bit disappointed.  Yes, he retired (at the age of 25) from competitive running before I was born but his records and performances are pretty impressive even by today&#39;s standards.  That said, I grew up in the &quot;Bruce Fordyce gives Comrades another good hiding&quot; era, so maybe that explains why he hasn&#39;t shown up on my radar until now.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Race Report: Abingdon Marathon 2013</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-abingdon-marathon-2013\"/>\n   <updated>2013-10-21T12:20:10+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-abingdon-marathon-2013</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I took my first stab at a sub-3 hour marathon at the Milton Keynes marathon and &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/it-wasnt-my-day-today&quot;&gt;completely misjudged things&lt;/a&gt; and in retrospect probably my abilities at the time, and completely blew it. On Sunday I took another stab at that elusive sub-3 marathon mark in my third ever marathon, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abingdonmarathon.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Abingdon Marathon&lt;/a&gt;, and smashed it out of the ballpark.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following my disappointing run at the Milton Keynes marathon I decided I was going to create a properly structured training programme that would guide me to a great marathon time.  After a little bit of research and reading I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/marathoning-hansons-way?page=single&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marathoning The Hansons&#39; Way&lt;/a&gt;.  Intrigued by this approach and the relative simplicity (compared to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Daniels-Running-Formula-Second-Edition-ebook/dp/B007VFDCCA/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Daniels Runner Formula&lt;/a&gt;), I purchased their book - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hansons-Marathon-Method-Renegade-ebook/dp/B00AWE9686/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hansons Marathon Method&lt;/a&gt; - in Kindle format, read it, and devised my four month training programme.  This ended up being a great programme which I&#39;ll cover that in another post. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;My Performance&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With lots of good hard training in my legs (over 1200km worth) I hit the road Sunday morning with two goals in mind: an absolute &lt;em&gt;&quot;I must get under 3 hours&quot;&lt;/em&gt; goal and a &lt;em&gt;&quot;it would be brilliant if I got under 2 hours 55 mins too&quot;&lt;/em&gt; goal.  Being the optimist that I am, and given my top form this season, I went out aiming for 2h55m from the gun with the idea that I&#39;ll have 5 mins to spare if I over-cook things (not likely) and if I still have something in my legs at the end, I could go faster.  A little bit of pre-calculation determined I&#39;d need to average 4:08/km for 2h55m and just over 4:15/km for 2h:59m:59s so I aimed for 4:08/km, give or take a few seconds due to bunching, hills, water tables and turns for the first half.  This worked well and I actually found it quite hard to hold back at the beginning.  It was so tempting to go out with the tide of over-eager people, but I remained strong and held back knowing that the tide would soon turn and I&#39;d be the one doing all the overtaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Abingdon2013-2-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;In the zone making up my way back up the field&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;In the &quot;zone&quot; making up my way back up the field on the 2nd lap.&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I did a pretty good job of holding back and soon got into a good groove just a little quicker than 4:08/km which saw me through halfway a little ahead of schedule.  Had I stuck to 4:08/km, I&#39;d have gone through halfway in about 1h27m12s.  I went through halfway in 1h26m51s, so pretty close to schedule.  Knowing I was pretty much on schedule I decided I didn&#39;t need to hold back quite so much, so I went with what felt good and stopped concentrating too hard on my pace.  By this time the tide had turned and I was slowly passing people and working my way back up the field and as I got closer to the end, I found the tide was coming in at a rapid rate of knots; I was catching and passing people at quite a clip.  I&#39;d see them ahead of me and without too much effort, they&#39;d soon be behind me and I&#39;d have my eyes set on the next pair of heels ahead of me.  This worked well to keep me occupied during the second lap of the race in which I ended up continuing at about 4:08/km with my one and only sub-4 minute kilometre at 35km (3:42!! what was I thinking?) and a few kilometres around 4:20/km on the little hills (they felt way bigger than they really were) in the last 4 kilometres.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up smashing my previous PB of 3h22m40s set at Milton Keynes by nearly 30 minutes and crossed the line in a gun time of 2h53:58s and a chip time (the one that counts &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;) of 2h53:50s in 27th place (out of 703 finishers).  I didn&#39;t quite achieve a negative split, but I was pretty close with 1h26m51s and 1h26m59s.  I blame the slight hill in the last 4km for this &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To say I&#39;m chuffed is an understatement.  I&#39;m over the moon.  On the way back to the car I said to my wife that I don&#39;t think I&#39;m cut out for marathons as I was feeling knackered, on the verge of cramping and with a tight knot for a stomach but now I&#39;ve had a few days to recover - I&#39;ve recovered surprisingly quickly - I think maybe I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; cut out for these marathons; I just need a bit more practice.  After all, this is only my 3rd marathon and only my fourth race of a 42.2km or more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The Race&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The race itself is a very well organised affair with loads of support, adequate water tables and plenty marshals on route.  Talking of the route, this race is rated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/event-editorial/readers-top-10-uk-races-pb-potential/4965.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Runner&#39;s World readers as the best race for PB potential&lt;/a&gt; and I agree as this is a relatively flat course with an ever-so slight downward trend in the first 5km and a slight upward trend in the last 4km with a little &quot;bump&quot; at about 11km and 26km.  That said, I think a few changes to the route could make it even quicker &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;  Between the 5th and 6th kilometre markers you come off the roads and run along a rather narrow path. This is quite a bottleneck this early in the race and this year proved to be rather muddy too.  The last kilometre is along the winding footpath within Tilsley Park just before you enter the stadium for your last 300m on the tartan track. This is quite tough on the old legs at the end of a marathon.  Oh, and they really need to get the council to come along and temporarily remove the barriers at the entrance to the path between North Quay and Andersey Way; this really breaks your stride as it&#39;s a very narrow gap, barely wider than shoulder width, that requires a fair degree of maneuvering to get through.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Other than that, a very good race.  It&#39;s not surprising this one is so popular and the choice for several country championships.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Other Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A few more incidentals, more for my own records than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I ran in&lt;/strong&gt;: a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Product-View-Road-X-Treme-138.html?L=26&amp;A=Road&amp;G=Male&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inov-8 Road X-treme 138&lt;/a&gt;. These are now my favourite long run and racing flat.  They&#39;re incredibly light (UK8 = 138g), very flexible, offer very little in the way of cushioning, are flat with no heel drop and best off all, they don&#39;t rub between my toes on long runs and in races like Vibram Five Fingers do. I&#39;m going to write a post about these soon.  I still love VFFs, just not racing or running too long in them. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As for nutrition: all LCHF though slightly higher carb than usual as I still need some carbs in my muscles to run a marathon.  My carb of choice is the sweet potato as it has a much lower GI than regular potatoes, none of the nasties of regular potatoes and it&#39;s obviously gluten free.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-race dinner&lt;/strong&gt;: a rather large faggot from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lockeyfarm.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lockey Farm shop&lt;/a&gt; with sweet potato, coconut and chilli mash and roast carrots enjoyed with two small bottles of beer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-race breakfast&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bulletproofexec.com/how-to-make-your-coffee-bulletproof-and-your-morning-too/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a bulletproof coffee&lt;/a&gt;, a heaped teaspoon of almond butter, a small portion of fruit salad made up of pineapple and honeydew melon and about 4 tablespoons of leftover sweet potato mash, all consumed before 7am.  I like to ensure all my eating is done at least 2 hours before the start of the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race supplementation and hydration&lt;/strong&gt;: water and a single homemade &quot;gel&quot; at 28km, though in retrospect I probably didn&#39;t need this.  It was more of a &quot;just in case&quot; thing.  The &quot;gel&quot; was 1 teaspoon almond butter mixed with 1 teaspoon of coconut oil left in the fridge overnight and then warmed in my back pocket until consumed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Hannibal Smith from the A-Team used to say...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love it when a plan comes together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My training, diet, race plan, kit, hydration and nutrition all fell into place perfectly on the day when it counted leading to one of my most enjoyable and best performances ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">The Big Day</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/the-big-day\"/>\n   <updated>2013-10-20T06:44:51+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/the-big-day</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;This is the big day I&#39;ve been training for: the Abingdon Marathon.

Once back in the office, I checked if I could enter on the day - I could - and the previous year&#39;s results and I thought I&#39;d have a chance at a podium finish so decided I&#39;d do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning I popped down to TVP, registered and entered the race.  As is common with races people shoot off from the start and a group of about 8 guys headed off ahead of me.  I wasn&#39;t too worried and played things safe and ran at my own pace.  I was soon up in 5th place and then started reeling in the guys ahead of me. I was in 4th by 6km with the third place guy in my sights: first and second were long gone and out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I then closed the gap on the third place guy and was hot on his heels by the 8km mark.  At this point he seemed to slow down, so I slowed a little too as I wasn&#39;t sure if he was going to try and burn me at the end.  I soon determined his legs were shot and there was no way he was going to keep up with me, so I took him and pulled a comfortable gap with about 1km to go.  It was at this point I noticed that the 2nd place chap wasn&#39;t actually that far ahead of me.  I think with a bit of effort I could have caught him had I seen him sooner &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I finished strongly and in a time of 35:20 gun time and 35:18 chip time shaving 1:05 off my previous PB.  Chuffed to bits about getting both a podium finish (got a trophy but no cash :-( ) and a huge new PB.  In retrospect, I think I might have been able to break 35mins had I not been scared of being challenged by the guy who eventually came forth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next up: Abingdon Marathon in which I&#39;m aiming for a sub-3.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Ordered a Running Treat</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/ordered-a-running-treat\"/>\n   <updated>2013-10-06T19:05:19+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/ordered-a-running-treat</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s podium finish deserved a well earned treat for the winter: an @ashmei ultimate  softshell running jacket.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">3rd Parkrun First</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/3rd-parkrun-first\"/>\n   <updated>2013-09-21T11:12:10+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/3rd-parkrun-first</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I got to play rabbit today at Reading #parkrun.

They sound perfect for running and if they really do protect against odors as they say they do, then the high cost will soon be offset by the fact I wouldn&#39;t need to buy a new one when the smell got too bad to tolerate as they wouldn&#39;t start smelling.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, last week I received an email with an offer I couldn&#39;t refuse. So I dug out my wallet and invested in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ashmei.com/shop/mens-performance-running-gear/details/247/7/mens/mens-short-sleeve-merino-+-carbon-jersey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ashmei Short Sleeve Merino + Carbon Jersey&lt;/a&gt; in red (no black ones in stock).

I&#39;ve only run 900km in them and I&#39;ve already worn through the fabric between the toes, which isn&#39;t ideal for an offroad shoe.  In my hunt for a new offroad shoe, I ventured back to VIVOBAREFOOT and got myself a pair of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vivobarefoot.com/uk/mens/off-road/breatho-trail-mens-2063.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Breatho Trails&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;VIVOBAREFOOT Breatho Trails&quot; src=&quot;/assets/breatho-trail.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;602&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve already got a pair of the older read and grey Breatho Trails which I use as a casual shoe so thought they&#39;d be great in the green and black to actually run in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On Saturday I took my new Breathos for a spin round &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reading parkrun&lt;/a&gt; for their first outing and they performed really well.  They did a great job of offering traction on the grass and gravel and offered good protection from the stones on the paths without taking too much away from the barefoot feel. I enjoyed running in them so much I got within 2 seconds of a PB without even realising it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All however was not rosy, and I only noticed this when I stopped running. The design of the shoe is a bit like a liner with an integrated tongue.  The part near the opening of the shoe are lovely and soft and really leads you to believe they&#39;d be great without socks.  However, this isn&#39;t the case. Deeper into the shoe, the nice soft lining stops and the stitching is exposed.  This rubbed the inside of my left arch a little and rubbed the metatarsal heads on both my big toes right through...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Breatho Blisters&quot; src=&quot;/assets/breatho-blisters.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Ugly feet blighted by rubbed raw blisters&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was only after I&#39;d leaked and hobbled my way home again - I ran to and from the parkrun as my warmup and cooldown - did I discover this was due to the exposed stitching.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, a great shoe and I&#39;ll definitely be running these into the ground, I just wish the lining completely covered all the internal stitching so I wouldn&#39;t have to wear socks when running in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">New Vivobarefoot Breatho Trails</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/new-vivobarefoot\"/>\n   <updated>2013-08-03T08:06:58+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/new-vivobarefoot</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Off to take my new @VIVOBAREFOOT Breatho Trails for a spin round @Readingparkrun.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Run on Barcelona Beach Front</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/run-on-barcelona-beach-front\"/>\n   <updated>2013-07-10T08:32:54+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/run-on-barcelona-beach-front</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Just had a great early morning run along Barcelona&#39;s beach front.

Naturally I had to go back and listen to my South African heros like Tim Noakes (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marathontalk.com/podcast/episode_47_prof_tim_noakes.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#47&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marathontalk.com/podcast/episode_142_prof_tim_noakes.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#142&lt;/a&gt;), Bruce Fordyce (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marathontalk.com/podcast/episode_38_bruce_fordyce_part_one.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#38&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marathontalk.com/podcast/episode_39_bruce_fordyce_part_two.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#39&lt;/a&gt;) and Zola Budd (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marathontalk.com/podcast/episode_140_zola_budd_part_one.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#140&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marathontalk.com/podcast/episode_141_zola_budd_part_two.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#141&lt;/a&gt; - still need to listen to these two) and of course their special on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comrades.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Comrades Marathon&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marathontalk.com/podcast/episode_73_comrades.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#73&lt;/a&gt;) when Martin &amp; Tom ran it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I find listening to my childhood heros and the topics I&#39;m interested in quite motivational and a great way to keep me occupied on those long gentle runs, however what I didn&#39;t expect was the effect the Comrades podcast would have on me.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nDuring the podcast they played these 3 minutes taken live at the start line of the 2011 Comrades Marathon...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;audio controls&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/ComradesStart-2011-MarathonTalk.mp3&quot; type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n  &lt;source src=&quot;/assets/ComradesStart-2011-MarathonTalk.ogg&quot; type=&quot;audio/ogg&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nYour browser does not support the audio element.

It&#39;s a cultural thing in South Africa and a bit of a tradition in my family.  Even if you aren&#39;t a runner, you know all about the Comrades Marathon and you will almost certainly haul yourself out of bed a little earlier to watch your fellow countrymen and women slog their guts out on the road between Durban and Pietermaritzburg.  You will almost certainly be back in front of the TV at the end of the day to watch the second most famous person, after the winner, in that year&#39;s race: the last person to cross the line before the 12 hour cut off.  It&#39;s a heartbreaking moment but gripping TV.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to the clip.  There&#39;s something about this clip that really strike a chord with me.  When I first heard it one crisp Sunday morning, it sent shivers through me; when it started, when Shoshaloza was sung, when the traditional cockrel crowed, when Chariots of Fire played and then when the gun went off and the announced announced the start of the race.  By the end of the little segment I was on the verge of tears with a great big lump in my throat and I was almost walking.  For some reason this little clip has had a profound impact on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/i-b7T3ppW/0/L/Simon_RunnersWorld-L.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Simon_RunnersWorld-S.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Simon Crossing the line at Two Oceans 2013&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;What a brilliant race photo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Guess what; today&#39;s run was interrupted by another one of these &quot;episodes&quot; when they played the exact clip again in this week&#39;s podcast (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marathontalk.com/podcast/episode_177_matt_briggs.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#177&lt;/a&gt;) and I decided I just had to share this with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Comrades is on my list of races to do and I WILL be doing it before I&#39;m 40; hopefully at least once in each direction.  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be able to run it enough times to get my permanent number, but we&#39;ll see, I&#39;m still young.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the topic of Comrades, good luck to everyone running it on Sunday.  I WILL be doing everything I can to locate a live stream I can watch from the UK.  A special good luck goes to my cousin who&#39;s gunning for a great time (Wally Haywood medal?) following his tremendous Silver medal (just dipping under 4 hours) and fantastic Runner&#39;s World and mantlepiece worthy photo in this year&#39;s Two Oceans.

Didn&#39;t get even close to sub-3 hours, let alone the 2:55 I had in mind. I was well on target until just before half-way when my right knee said &quot;Sorry boyks, no 2:55 for you today&quot;. Then with about 5km to go my calves very loudly told me &quot;You can write off the sub-3:15 too&quot;. In the end I hobbled round the stadium (it was quite embarrassing) and across the line in 124th place and a disappointing 3:22:50. So it looks like no London 2014 for me. All is not bad though, it&#39;s a PB by a whopping 49 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Update: 3:22:50 is my gun time. Chip time and ergo new PB is 3:22:40.

She&#39;s not a runner so in order to get her prepared for it we&#39;re following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cool Running Couch-to-5K programme&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a great little programme which slowly builds you to running a whole 5k which I think is perfect for my wife.  I also quite like to get to play coach and add in an additional run several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So a couple of weeks ago we set off and things started quite well. My wife is nowhere near as unfit as she thought, though she&#39;s also nowhere near fit enough to run a full 5k. As a result we&#39;ve actually been doing slightly more in terms of distance per session than the training programme suggests. Things were going well for the first week and a half and then she got one heck of a headcold and suspected ear infection so the running stopped.  We then picked things up again yesterday and had a nice gentle run.  Today we went out again and I thought I&#39;d be a little cheeky and change things slightly and see how she coped.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re meant to be doing the third day of week two: &lt;em&gt;Brisk five-minute warmup walk. Then alternate 90 seconds of jogging and two minutes of walking for a total of 20 minutes.&lt;/em&gt; but as yesterday went so well and as we&#39;ve been doing a bit more than the programme suggests (yesterday was 38mins of 90sec run, 2min walk), I upped the running intervals to two minutes each and kept the walking intervals at two minutes each.  I also cunningly devised a nice mostly offroad route that was just short of 5k.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I&#39;m pleased to say keeping the conversation going really helped and I think she noticed less of today&#39;s run than yesterday.  We got back home midway through a running interval so ran back and forth up and down the road until the last two minutes were up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The result: my wife walked/run 5k on the nose in a time of 43:35 without even knowing it and coped really well. I&#39;m chuffed she&#39;s finally hit the 5k mark.  Now she just needs to work on running the whole way and she&#39;ll breeze through her charity run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This afternoon&#39;s little saunter made a great little pre-race warm-up for tomorrow. I&#39;m feeling great and rested and am really looking forward to tomorrow&#39;s race... my first marathon in over 14 years.  The weather&#39;s looking good too so it should be a good day out.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Boston Magazine Tribute Cover</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/boston-magazine-tribute-cover\"/>\n   <updated>2013-04-27T11:31:14+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/boston-magazine-tribute-cover</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I think this is a fantastic and apt cover on the May edition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostonmagazine.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boston Magazine&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Boston Magazine Cover - May&quot; src=&quot;/assets/BostonMagazineCover.jpg&quot; width=&quot;570&quot; height=&quot;748&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2013/04/25/behind-our-may-boston-marathon-cover/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We initially settled on the idea of commissioning Marathon-related essays from a number of Boston writers, and then set about brainstorming ideas for illustrating that package of stories. Should we create a photo illustration of a runner’s bib in the shape of a heart? Should we photograph a tattered marathon olive wreath on a black background? Then our design director, Brian Struble, and deputy design director, Liz Noftle, came up with the concept of taking shoes worn during the marathon and arranging them so that the negative space is in the shape of a heart. For reasons I’ll explain in a moment, I knew as soon as I heard the idea that we had our concept—not just for the collection of essays, but also for the cover. In fact, I quickly realized that the stories of the runners who wore those shoes would be even more powerful than the essays we’d commissioned. We quickly changed course and settled on the cover concept and the outlines of a feature package: We’d shoot the shoes collectively to form the heart, but we’d also photograph them as individual pairs to illustrate the stories told by the runners in the package (which we called “The Shoes We Wore,” and which you’ll find in the May issue).&lt;br /&gt;\n— &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2013/04/25/behind-our-may-boston-marathon-cover/&quot; title=&quot;Behind Our May Boston Marathon Cover&quot;&gt;Behind Our May Boston Marathon Cover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What a great idea and fitting tribute.

I finished, but not in a time worthy of screaming from the rooftops... 4:11 which is terrible when you consider my beautifully paced Two Oceans (56km) time of 4:48.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&#39;ve not raced anything further than 32km since, so I really don&#39;t have any recent marathon efforts to go on and thus I have to base my predictions on my performances over shorter distances.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nOne of the most popular formulas to use is Pete Riegel&#39;s formula (first published in Runner&#39;s World and still used in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/general/rws-race-time-predictor/1681.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this calculator&lt;/a&gt;)...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;t2 = t1 * (d2 / d1)&lt;sup&gt;1.06&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... where t1 is the given time, d1 is the given distance, d2 is the distance to predict a time for, and t2 is the calculated time for d2.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I won&#39;t explain the formula, you can read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://stathletics.tumblr.com/post/14931342638/riegels-equivalent-performance-formula&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I will say it is just a model.  A very good model, but not a 100% reliable and precise model.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if I take my best time for the distance closest to the marathon, the half-marathon at 1:19:53, and bung it into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/training-calculators-racetimes.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;calculator on Fetchpoint&lt;/a&gt; I get ...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table style=&quot;width: 250px; margin: 0 auto&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Dist&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Estimate&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Actual PB&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;5k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;17:22&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;17:36 &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot; id=&quot;1&quot; title=&quot;Offroad.

Really!? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;OK, I&#39;ll let you into a secret, I discovered this earlier this year and it&#39;s been on my mind ever since. Now I&#39;ve not done much in the way of desired marathon paced training as I&#39;m testing to see if my success last season with MAF carries over to the marathon this year, however I have not been doing MAF exclusively. I&#39;ve also been doing one marathon specific speed session... &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/yasso-800s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yasso 800s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now the idea behind Yasso 800s is you do 800m intervals at the m:s time of your desired marathon&#39;s h:m time with 400m recovery between each. Each 400 is covered in the same amount of time as the 800s. Now the theory goes that it your regularly run 100+ km weeks and you can do 10 of these reps all at the desired pace, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;re in shape to run your marathon in your desired time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, yesterday I did my last Yasso 800s session and completed all 10 at my desired pace of approx 2:44-2:46/800m with 400m recovery in about 2:45 and I&#39;m chuffed to bits, however I&#39;m not confident about this 2:46 + &quot;a few minutes&quot; marathon I&#39;m supposed to be capable of. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;m in great form, but can I really do it?  It would be brilliant if I could and push it under 2:45 too as dipping under 2:45 means I can start the London Marathon with the elite men (I&#39;ll stand a long way behind Mo Farah &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;). That said, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll being finding out if I can on 6 May as I have one goal for this marathon: run sub-3:15 so I can qualify for next year&#39;s London Marathon by the &quot;Good for Age&quot; route.  I&#39;m actually gunning for sub-3 as I think I can do that, however I don&#39;t want to blow it gunning for an almost impossible time... 42.2km is a long way to run and get it horribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll certainly push things a bit if everything is going really well at the halfway mark. I think I&#39;ll leave the experimenting for the Abingdon Marathon in October.  Who knows, maybe I can get a 2:46-ish time then when I&#39;m a little more confident. &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Mo Does Half of VLM2013</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/mo-does-half-of-vlm2013\"/>\n   <updated>2013-04-21T11:06:10+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/mo-does-half-of-vlm2013</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;A little part of me is disappointed Mo Farah didn&#39;t shock the world and actually complete the #VLM2013.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Good Luck VLM2013 Runners</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/good-luck-vlm2013-runners\"/>\n   <updated>2013-04-21T09:06:01+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/good-luck-vlm2013-runners</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;What a lovely day for a marathon.

It was lovely and dry and sunny, though still cold. Good watch time too: 1:01:18. Not bad considering the stage I&#39;m at in my marathon training. Next week will be my last 100k+ week before my marathon.  Think I may need to start considering an alternate shoe to race in too... the Vibram Seeyas keep giving me blisters between my some of my toes, but not all the time.  I&#39;m reluctant to change shoes as I love running in the Seeyas.  Might tape my toes for my marathon and then keep my eyes peeled for something just a light and minimal, but without the toe pockets.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Grizedale Duathlon</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/grizedale-duathlon\"/>\n   <updated>2013-03-26T10:16:46+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/grizedale-duathlon</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;On Sunday 10 March I took part in my first offroad duathlon, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highterrainevents.co.uk/2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Grizedale duathlon&lt;/a&gt; in the Grizedale Forest in the Lake District, and what an event it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Going to The Lakes just before Easter has become a bit of a habit for my wife and me.  It&#39;s normally a nice time to go as things are starting to get warmer, the signs of spring are starting to appear, all the sheep are starting to lamb and best of all, it&#39;s before the school holidays so it&#39;s cheaper and quieter.  One of the things we always do is go for a walk round Grizedale forest. There are loads of different paths and routes of varying technicality so there&#39;s always a walk or two to keep us entertained for a few hours. The last few times we&#39;ve been we&#39;ve noticed the remnants of the duathlon that would have taken place on the Sunday we arrived and each time I say that it would be nice to take part.  So this year that&#39;s precisely what we did.  We made sure we went up at the same time as the duathlon, which also happened to coincide with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hawksheadbrewery.co.uk/more_info_extra.asp?current_id=90&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hawkshead Brewery spring beer festival&lt;/a&gt;, and I entered the duathlon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe arrived in Ambleside Saturday afternoon to some rather chilly weather and the beautiful sight of snow on the peaks. The forecast for the next day wasn&#39;t looking too rosy either with more snow overnight and wind and sleet on the cards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And that is exactly what we got... more snow and the wind blowing in over those snow covered peaks. As you can guess it was freezing on Sunday morning, but thankfully not raining.  Despite the cold, my wife, her parents and I wrapped up, strapped my bike to the car and headed over to Grizedale forest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once there, I unracked my bike and we walked up to the visitor centre to register and get ready for the race.  Following the compulsory pre-race briefing and a gentle warmup run, we were sent on our way for the first run, and what a run it was... almost straight up and then pretty much straight back down...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Run Profile&quot; src=&quot;/assets/run-elevation.png&quot; width=&quot;542&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Profile of the run route as recorded by my watch.&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The peak of the run is Carron Crag, the second highest point in Grizedale at a breath-taking height of 314 metres (1,030 ft) above sea-level.  Now getting up the hill the first time round was quite tough but enjoyable.  I took things relatively easy and enjoyed the run up and was quite pleased with the fact my Vibram Five Finger Spyridons seemed to be doing a brilliant job, however the same can&#39;t be said for the decent. The decent was much steeper than the ascent and very very rocky.  This is where the Vibrams weren&#39;t really the best things to be wearing.  Whilst I had to carefully place my feet, my fellow competitors wearing boots (by comparison) didn&#39;t seem to pay too much attention to where they planted their feet and went tearing down the hill.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once at the bottom, it was into the transition area.  This duathlon uses chipped based timing, but instead of using a strap round your ankle, you have a strap round your wrist with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportident.co.uk/equipment/shop/item.php?id=7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dibber&lt;/a&gt; that needed to be &quot;dipped&quot; into the stations at the entrance and exit of the transition area.  Prior to this event, I&#39;d always considered the transition area as a quick in-and-out area and quite important in the grand scheme of things.  This isn&#39;t the case on this duathlon as people didn&#39;t seem to be in any hurry to pass through the transition area whenever I was in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; alt=&quot;Red Route Description&quot; src=&quot;/assets/red-route.png&quot; width=&quot;137&quot; height=&quot;135&quot; /&gt;Anyway, my first run went well and I completed it in 34:33 and spent 48 seconds in the transition area before heading off on the bike.  Straight away I knew this was going to be a tough ride.  The first 800m were on a wide gravel road, most of which we&#39;d just covered on the run, but then we took a sharp left turn onto a very narrow, very rocky and very steep path. I have now learnt this is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://visitlakelandforests.co.uk/index.php/component/ionfiles/?func=download&amp;fileid=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;North Face MTB trail&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) which has a &quot;Red Difficult&quot; rating.  The grading description on the right doesn&#39;t really convey how tough sections of this course are.  Take my word for it: it&#39;s tough, especially when mixing the single-track and very rocky paths with very steep climbs and descents mixed into a race environment. The cycle route didn&#39;t follow the entire North Face route, but most of it.  For me the best parts were the forest road sections... I&#39;m much more proficient on there sections.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As with the run, things were far from flat...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bike Profile&quot; src=&quot;/assets/cycle-elevation.png&quot; width=&quot;542&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Profile of the bike route as recorded by my watch.&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... and I found myself walking several sections as it was easier and considerably quicker than trying to cycle up the steep hills.  In fact, other than the forest road sections, this is the only time I overtook someone instead of being overtaken, and a lot of people overtook me &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; alt=&quot;timing slip &quot; src=&quot;/assets/timing-slip.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;576&quot; /&gt;Coupled with the incredibly tough riding conditions we got to experience some pretty tough weather conditions too.  Lots of strong winds and even snow flurries at the highest points of the ride contributed to making the race tough and I found myself shivering, despite being well wrapped up, in some of the windier sections.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At about 20km into the bike, I made the fatal mistake of thinking to myself: &quot;&lt;em&gt;You&#39;re doing well and you&#39;ve not fallen off&lt;/em&gt;&quot; and with that I instantly lost my grip with my right hand and took a drink from a very cold muddy puddle.  The last 4kms were just as tough as the earlier parts, but now I had ice-cold wet gloves and the very real fear of losing my grip again and eating a bit more dirt.  Thankfully that didn&#39;t happen and I managed to make it back to the transition area in a much slower than expected 1:52:06... I had expected to do the bike about 20-30 minutes quicker.  My second transition was much slower at 1:49 as I couldn&#39;t get my helmet off as my fingers were so numb I couldn&#39;t feel the clip.  Thankfully there were some people in the transition and I asked someone to undo my helmet for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All was not bad on the bike though... the views over Coniston Water were spectacular and incredibly beautiful with the the snow-covered peaks providing a lovely backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This second run was significantly more difficult than the first run.  My legs were incredibly tired from the bike and my quads started cramping every time I made any attempt to run uphill.  Running on the flat and downhill wasn&#39;t a problem, just the uphills.  As I couldn&#39;t actually do much running, I ended up walking a fair amount of the first half of the second run.  Normally I don&#39;t walk if I don&#39;t have to but I had no choice in the matter, my legs just wouldn&#39;t run without cramping.  I wasn&#39;t alone though, almost everyone around me on the second run were experiencing the same difficulties.  Naturally my second run time was significantly slower and I finished it in 45:19 giving me an overall time of 3:14:35.  I didn&#39;t have a goal time, but I had originally thought I&#39;d finish in less than 3 hours.  I readjusted my expectations part way through the cycle and decided on trying to get in under 3:15 which I managed to do, just.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://results.sportident.co.uk/home/event.html?eventid=8cdfffd4-0ec5-444c-9c2c-f1bc2ea5806a&amp;mobile=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official results&lt;/a&gt;, I finished in 86th place out of 157 finishers which isn&#39;t too bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, a great day out but definitely not an event I&#39;ll be doing on my own again... someone else can do the bike leg next time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d also like to say a great big huge thank-you to my mother-in-law for spending Mother&#39;s Day out in the cold watching me, my father-in-law for keeping my fans sane during the event and my wife for playing taxi after the event.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Cold World Cross-country Champs</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/cold-world-cross-country-champs\"/>\n   <updated>2013-03-24T12:21:06+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/cold-world-cross-country-champs</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;It looks a tad colder at the world cross-country champs in Poland than it was on my long run this morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Becoming the All-Terrain Human</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/becoming-the-all-terrain-human\"/>\n   <updated>2013-03-23T18:02:28+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/becoming-the-all-terrain-human</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;How&#39;s this for an introduction for an ultrarunner?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/magazine/creating-the-all-terrain-human.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kilian Jornet Burgada is the most dominating endurance athlete of his generation. In just eight years, Jornet has won more than 80 races, claimed some 16 titles and set at least a dozen speed records, many of them in distances that would require the rest of us to purchase an airplane ticket. He has run across entire landmasses­ (Corsica) and mountain ranges (the Pyrenees), nearly without pause. He regularly runs all day eating only wild berries and drinking only from streams. On summer mornings he will set off from his apartment door at the foot of Mont Blanc and run nearly two and a half vertical miles up to Europe’s roof — over cracked glaciers, past Gore-Tex’d climbers, into the thin air at 15,781 feet — and back home again in less than seven hours, a trip that mountaineers can spend days to complete. A few years ago Jornet ran the 165-mile Tahoe Rim Trail and stopped just twice to sleep on the ground for a total of about 90 minutes. In the middle of the night he took a wrong turn, which added perhaps six miles to his run. He still finished in 38 hours 32 minutes, beating the record of Tim Twietmeyer, a legend in the world of ultrarunning, by more than seven hours. When he reached the finish line, he looked as if he’d just won the local turkey trot.&lt;br /&gt;\n— &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/magazine/creating-the-all-terrain-human.html?_r=0&quot; title=&quot;Becoming the All-Terrain Human - NYTimes.com&quot;&gt;Becoming the All-Terrain Human - NYTimes.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Very good, and long article about a very impressive runner.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Wife Starting Running</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/wife-starting-running\"/>\n   <updated>2013-03-23T14:43:14+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/wife-starting-running</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;My wife took her first step towards becoming a runner today by buying a pair of Merrell Pace Glove minimalist running shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Strange Looks From Man Carrying a Brick</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/strange-looks-from-man-carrying-a-brick\"/>\n   <updated>2013-03-20T15:07:46+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/strange-looks-from-man-carrying-a-brick</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I got some strange looks on my run today (for my Vibrams) from a man running with a brick in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Moonboots</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/moonboots\"/>\n   <updated>2013-03-19T16:06:24+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/moonboots</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Check out these bad boys...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;HokaOneOne.jpg&quot; src=&quot;/assets/HokaOneOne.jpg&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Lightweight Moonboots?&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I thought these were a spoof when I first saw the image, but it appears they&#39;re a genuine product and the pair in the picture is trail shoe!?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hokaoneone.eu/en/technology.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; in these shoes is impressive, in particular the explanation for the huuuuuuge drop...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 2.5x the volume of EVA in the midsole compared to standard running shoes.

Vibrams at speed in the wet result in some beautiful blisters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Preliminary results give me a chip time to 1:22:24 and I finished in 133rd position.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and I entered the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkshireathletics.org.uk/rr.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Berkshire Champs for 2013&lt;/a&gt;, just to see how I do. 1 done, 3 more to go, assuming I actually get into the Abingdon Marathon.  Not holding my breath as that is a popular fast race.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Race No. 25 At Wokingham Half</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-no-25-at-wokingham-half\"/>\n   <updated>2013-02-09T11:05:31+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-no-25-at-wokingham-half</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;My race no for tomorrow&#39;s Wokingham Half is 25.

I digress.&lt;br /&gt;\nWhen you started using the MAF principle; did you experience your heart rate monitor pinging off before you even felt you where actually getting into your stride?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have tried this for a month now (and even though you suggest trying for 3 months at least) I am finding it utterly soul destroying. I feel like it want to rip the HRM off and smash it to smithereens because it must be lying to me, constantly pinging saying heart rate too high, I am barely moving.&lt;br /&gt;\nI have read Dr Mafftones Big book of endurance and this situation is often referenced, people can seemingly run happily a lot faster than they can slower. Driving me nuts.&lt;br /&gt;\nJust wondering if you had to go through this phase or your aerobic capacity was already sufficient to operate at a low HR?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that stops me throwing the HRM in the next brook is, it works fine when out on the bike. Can keep the HR nicely at may max level of 135bpm.&lt;br /&gt;\nI can only conclude. Running is far more taxing than cycling, my aerobic capacity or running economy is shockingly poor or both.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Any words of wisdom would be much appreciated. Failing that, the simple cold truth, is my own conclusion about right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jason the dis heartend&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t feel dis-heartened, you&#39;re not alone.  This is actually a very common issue and I did indeed experience the same frustration as you are experiencing.  My body used to be primed for fast training and I could and would whiz through training sessions at significantly higher heart rates. This however isn&#39;t very good for MAF and I had to be patient.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nOne suggestion you might like to try is adding 5 or 10 BPM to your MAF limit and try that for a few weeks to a month, then slowly start decreasing back down to your calculated MAF value.  A colleague experienced the same issue as you and found this worked really well for him.  He didn&#39;t drop back to his calculated MAF HR in the end though, but he is an older athlete (the MAF calc starts to become a bit sketchy in older trained athletes) and his new calculated HR was significantly lower than he&#39;d been training at before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, I effectively did this myself without even realising it as I spent a few months before completely switching to MAF following some of the ideas of &quot;Hadd&#39;s Approach to Distance Training&quot; as mentioned and referenced in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/does-maf-training-work&quot;&gt;Does Maximum Aerobic Function (MAF) Training Work?&lt;/a&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once your body gets used to running at such a low HR, you&#39;ll find you will still get days like this when you feel like you&#39;re not moving and your HRM just won&#39;t stop beeping.  Generally these indicate you&#39;re going a lot quicker than you really think you are (everyone loves to feel on top of the world), you&#39;re running in tougher climatic conditions (wind, heat and cold do crazy things with the HR), you&#39;re tired, or your body may not be 100% and could be giving you an early indication of either over-training or a pending cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On these days I try to slow my pace and lower my HR whilst taking into account all of these factors.  If I still can&#39;t get my HR down and can&#39;t explain the elevation, I cut my run short and head for the showers.  My body is probably telling me something and ignoring it will just annoy me and possibly lead to injury or illness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So in summary, don&#39;t feel disheartened and don&#39;t give in just yet. It&#39;s perfectly normal.  Try running at a slightly higher HR for a few weeks and see how you get on.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Cousin Runs Sub-3 on LCHF</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/cousin-runs-sub-3-on-lchf\"/>\n   <updated>2013-01-27T18:59:02+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/cousin-runs-sub-3-on-lchf</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Congrats to @SimonGear for his spectacular return to form with his 1st official sub-3 hour marathon, thanks to @ProfTimNoakes &amp; LCHF&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Reading parkrun&#39;s Temporary New Home</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/reading-parkruns-temporary-new-home\"/>\n   <updated>2013-01-25T11:34:46+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/reading-parkruns-temporary-new-home</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Just spotted this on Twitter...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading parkrun is temporarily moving to Dinton Pastures Country Park, RG10 0TH from 2nd Feb 2013 till further notice. &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/61lCtqMC&quot; title=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/course/&quot;&gt;parkrun.org.uk/reading/course/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; Reading parkrun (@Readingparkrun) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Readingparkrun/status/294764304350212096&quot;&gt;January 25, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Woohoo, good to see Reading parkrun has a temporary new home, though I&#39;m very surprised it has taken flooding in TVP to get a parkrun at Dinton Pastures.

Are you absolutely sure about that?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Very little has been said about this…..On December 2, Basque athlete Iván Fernández Anaya was competing in a cross-country race in Burlada, Navarre. He was running second, some distance behind race leader Abel Mutai - bronze medalist in the 3,000-meter steeplechase at the London Olympics. As they entered the finishing straight, he saw the Kenyan runner - the certain winner of the race - mistakenly pull up about 10 meters before the finish, thinking he had already crossed the line.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fernández Anaya quickly caught up with him, but instead of exploiting Mutai&#39;s mistake to speed past and claim an unlikely victory, he stayed behind and, using gestures, guided the Kenyan to the line and let him cross first.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ivan Fernandez Anaya, a Basque runner of 24 years who is considered an athlete with a big future (champion of Spain of 5,000 meters in promise category two years ago) said after the test:&lt;br /&gt;\n&amp;quot;But even if they had told me that winning would have earned me a place in the Spanish team for the European championships, I wouldn&#39;t have done it either. I also think that I have earned more of a name having done what I did than if I had won. And that is very important, because today, with the way things are in all circles, in soccer, in society, in politics, where it seems anything goes, a gesture of honesty goes down well.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He said at the beginning: unfortunately, very little has been said of the gesture. And it&#39;s a shame. In my opinion, it would be nice to explain to children, so they do not think that sport is only what they see on TV: violent kicks in abundance, posh statements, fingers in the eyes of the enemy ...&lt;br /&gt;\n— &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=456447927743095&amp;amp;set=a.326047560783133.83173.325981127456443&amp;amp;type=1&quot; title=&quot;Is Winning All That Counts?

With that done, I think it&#39;s a good time to sum up my running for 2012.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So what happened in 2012 in my little running world?  Well, lots.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Training&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started the year by switching my training to follow the maximum aerobic function (MAF) theory and method devised by Phil Maffetone (see my post &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/does-maf-training-work&quot;&gt;Does Maximum Aerobic Function (MAF) Training Work?&lt;/a&gt; post from Saturday for more details) and experienced tremendous returns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I was running all of my training aerobically, I found I was recovering incredibly quickly and soon found I could run for an hour or more many days on the trot, including after a 2-to-3 hour long run on a Sunday.  As a result my mileage climbed to levels I&#39;ve never run before...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;training_2012.png&quot; src=&quot;/assets/training_2012.png&quot; width=&quot;610&quot; height=&quot;111&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Monthly training totals for 2009 - 2012 (all figures are in kilometers)&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, every month trumped the years before with 3 huge months: June, August and November, each over 300km.  I&#39;m not quite sure what happened in February and March as I didn&#39;t log the days I didn&#39;t run (that&#39;ll be changing next year), didn&#39;t document any complaints in my logs and didn&#39;t post any blog posts to suggest a problem.  I know I had a holiday in the lake district and I tapered (unnecessary in hindsight) for &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-reading-half-marathon-2012&quot;&gt;my first half-marathon in over 13 years&lt;/a&gt; in March, but that shouldn&#39;t have entirely accounted for such a poor showing in March.  February we can probably blame on the weather - I&#39;ve become much less of a fair-weather runner through the year &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within all this training are 5 weeks in which I covered more than 100km in each week with my biggest week being the week of 3 - 9 September when I clocked in 121.54km. Impressed?  I am &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; and I&#39;m chuffed to bits with the fact 8 of the 12 months have totals over 200km and the total of 2823km for the year.  This is 823km MORE than I thought I&#39;d cover when I set myself a target of 2000km for the year in January 2012.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So given the success I&#39;ve had so far with this training, more on the effects on my racing coming up, I&#39;m going to be sticking with this MAF training for a lot longer.  As I mentioned in Saturday&#39;s post, the only change I&#39;ll be introducing this year is a race-specific speed session once a fortnight.  I also plan to introduce a bit more strength work in the form of hills and full body weight sessions (got to get my money&#39;s worth in the gym) to the non-peak-racing parts of the year. Both will be closely monitored to see if they have a negative impact on my overall training and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After reading Phil Maffetone&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1616080655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Big Book of Endurance&lt;/a&gt;, I started to consider the merits of a lower carbohydrate diet.  I then read Tim Noakes&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1770221468/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Challenging Beliefs&lt;/a&gt; and I was convinced this was something I had to try and put to the test so I adopted a &quot;paleo-lite&quot; diet as I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/training-and-diet-update&quot;&gt;mid-year update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After experiencing some very good results, I finally took the plunge and dropped the carbs almost entirely.  No more pre-long run or pre-race carbs (I was still consuming some &quot;complex carbs&quot; until about June); just good ol&#39; fat and protein and lots of it and I&#39;ve not looked back and I don&#39;t think I will.  Thus far I&#39;ve not needed a stack of carbs before any of my runs and in fact I believe I now perform better by NOT having any carbs before I race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So with a good 6 months of a low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet I can say this works for me as...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have lost weight without even trying.  You may say performing the MAF training would have done this, and you&#39;re probably right, but only partly.  Once I switched to a LCHF diet, the weight just fell off.  I started the year weighing 81kg and soon stabilised at 79kg.  I&#39;m ending the year weighing 71kg with the biggest drop in their weight coming after I switched completely to the LCHF diet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I noticed my endurance improved significantly.  Once again, the MAF would have contributed to this, but I think switching to the LCHF helped even more as fat is definitely a better fuel source for me than carbohydrates.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I experienced much better and more consistent energy levels.  I&#39;m a lively chap most of the time, but I always found I had a slump around about 3pm each afternoon when I craved a choccy or some other quickfix carb snack - my will power was good so I very rarely gave in, but I still experienced the sugar low.  Things were particularly bad on the weekend when I tended not to have my mid-morning apple or banana.  I&#39;d then enter the state my wife and I call &quot;hangry&quot;.  It&#39;s when I&#39;d get grumpy, snappy and agitated because of low sugar levels.  Not anymore.  I can breeze through the afternoon or Saturday morning&#39;s shopping without even noticing the time or feeling the slightest bit peckish.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, my wife has switched to a LCHF diet with me, though with a bit less stringenc, and she too is reaping the benefits, except the running part - she&#39;s not a runner.  She does however miss the likes of bread (she&#39;s a huge marmite fan) and pasta more than me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So as with the MAF training, this is something else I&#39;ll be keeping up and I definitely encourage you to consider it too.  If anything, get hold of a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1609611543/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wheat Belly&lt;/a&gt; and try giving up just wheat to start with and see the benefits.

I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve run 5km on-road quicker, but not off-road.  I&#39;d also never run a half-marathon anywhere near 1h 20m before, let alone run under it and best of all, &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/should-i-be-running-a-10k-pb-in-a-half-marathon&quot;&gt;that half-marathon included a 10k PB&lt;/a&gt;. I can&#39;t wait for a nice fast 10k in 2013 to see if I can get a new all-time PB.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I can only put these great times down to the fantastic aerobic base the MAF training has given me and the adaptation of my body to a LCHF diet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am now running at a quicker pace than I was when I left South Africa at the ripe old age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Plans for 2013&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With 2012 behind me and 2013 looming on the horizon, it&#39;s time to think about my goals for next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My first and probably biggest goal is to run a sub-3 hour marathon at the Milton Keynes marathon in May and thus qualify for the 2014 London Marathon well within the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virginlondonmarathon.com/marathon-centre/enter-virgin-london-marathon/good-for-age-entries/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Good for age&quot; limit of 3:10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once that&#39;s out of the way I think I&#39;ll have a good go at the following goals...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;sub-17 5k&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;sub-36 10k&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;sub-78 1/2 marathon&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;run a 100km week at least once a month&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;exceed 3200km of running for the year - this isn&#39;t too important as I tend to train by time rather distance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think these are good attainable goals which are going to be tough to hit, but with some good training I think I might be able to accomplish them.  I&#39;m also going to start logging the days when I don&#39;t run so I can understand the fluctuations in monthly totals and gauge the effects of my training more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m really enjoying my running at the moment and really hope next year is another bumper year.

Slow Down&#39;&quot;&gt;maximum aerobic function (MAF) training by Phil Maffetone&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).  It seemed like an incredibly simplistic approach and I was a little skeptical about the efficacy of such a &quot;slow&quot; approach to running so I threw the question out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a lot of research and some good feedback from others I took a whole-hearted plunge into the world of MAF training on 23 January this year.  I didn&#39;t take the plunge sooner as I was still very concerned about the incredibly slow pace I&#39;d be training at and instead opted to finish out 2011 and most of January 2012 mixing up times and heart rate ranges using some of the ideas garnered from a huge article by John Hadd Walsh known as &quot;&lt;a title=&quot;A local copy for prosperity&quot; href=&quot;/assets/hadd.pdf&quot;&gt;Hadd’s Approach to Distance Training&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (PDF).  This served me well and I was soon building a good aerobic base and clocking up monthly totals I&#39;d not seen before: October 2011: 216km and November 2011: 252km.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, this served me well, but there was still this niggle in the back of mind: &quot;What would happen if I trained to the ideas of MAF?&quot;  Some of my training runs had been pretty close to my calculated MAF range so I&#39;d started to get used to the slower training pace. So I bought Phil&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1616080655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1616080655&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;big yellow book&lt;/a&gt;, read it, put my pride in my pocket and dived right in.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nNow for a quick recap.  The idea behind MAF is you perform all your training until you stop seeing improvements, under a heart rate calculated by subtracting your age from 180 and then adding or subtracting a few beats depending on experience, age, injury and general health.  My calculation was: &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;180 - 32&lt;/code&gt; (my age)&lt;code&gt; + 5&lt;/code&gt; (I&#39;m experienced)&lt;code&gt; = 153 BPM&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those who know me will know I&#39;m actually 33, and have been for the entire time I&#39;ve been whole-heartedly committed to MAF training this year, so I&#39;m not entirely sure why I chose 32 when performing the calculation.  I can only think I did the calculation sometime last year and didn&#39;t think to reduce it by one after my birthday.  That said, I doubt 1 BPM really made that much of a difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I then took 5 off that figure to set a lower heart rate and thus setup a range of 148 - 153 BPM.  Now this isn&#39;t part of MAF.  If I recall correctly, there is no mention of a lower heart rate to keep above, however I decided I&#39;d like a lower heart rate to try and keep all my training within a set range.  This would allow me to easily judge how my general well-being, health, mood and the weather affected my training. All warm ups and cool downs were performed at a heart rate lower than 148 BPM.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After an initial test on 13 September, I decided on a simple traffic-free flat 10km out-and-back (5k each way) route along the Thames as my test route (instead of chugging round a track until I got dizzy) and 30 January 2011 I performed my first MAF test for the year. It wasn&#39;t too bad, but wasn&#39;t brilliant.  Every kilometer, except the first, took over 5 mins to cover.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With my initial test out of the way, I set to doing all of my training in the 148-153 BPM heart range and as I did so I increased the time I ran.  Soon I was easily running over an hour a day, every day, without feeling tired. I felt like I&#39;d been for a run, but I wasn&#39;t knackered and breathing heavily at the end of it.  I really started to enjoy my running again and re-introduced the Sunday long run too.  These were done slightly differently in that I ran the first hour with my heart rate below 148 BPM and then the rest in my MAF range. This proved to be a great idea as I felt great after each long run and could easily head out for an hour on the Monday morning, which I normally do.  As a result my mileage climbed to new highs and my race times came tumbling down.  More on both of those coming in a post next week when I summarize the year&#39;s running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I persisted with the MAF training with absolutely no traditional speed work in my training.  The closest I got to speed work was road races and parkruns.  I tried to get some sort of consistency with performing the MAF tests to track my progress, but wasn&#39;t 100% successful on this as things like the weather and work stresses really affect the times so I had to skip a few or move them to later dates, but I still managed to get some in.  As the year progressed it soon became very clear that the MAF training was having a huge effect on my performance and I we definitely becoming a faster and more efficient runner by running slower.  Have a look at this....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/MAF_test_results_graph_2012.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;MAF Test Results Graph 2012&quot; src=&quot;/assets/MAF_test_results_graph_2012.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, bar a few anomalies (due to weather, stress etc), almost every MAF test showed an improvement with a huge leap between the May and July tests which I think can be attributed to re-introducing my Sunday long runs and a more concerted effort to follow a low-carb, high-fat diet (LCHF).  Interestingly the last 3 MAF tests had all but the last kilometer covered under 5:00/km. I&#39;ve not had a chance to do another test this year as mother nature has decided the Thames isn&#39;t wide enough around Reading and really needs the path I run on too &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I can conclusively say...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold; font-size:25px&quot;&gt;Yes, maximum aerobic function (MAF) training DOES work&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... and it works very very well, and best of all, I went into every race feeling fresh without doing any tapering what-so-ever.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So why does it work?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I think it&#39;s a combination of things...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1.  It forces you to go right back to basics and run long and slow and consistently.  Every good coach will tell you about the importance of building a good aerobic base, but very few emphasize this enough.  What&#39;s more the likes of Runner&#39;s World don&#39;t make it any easier as &quot;go out and run slowly and longer to get faster&quot; really doesn&#39;t sell magazines, not that anyone would believe the article anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2.  It is at a sufficiently slow speed that it is entirely aerobic and as a result it forces you to become more of a fat-burning machine than a carb-burning machine.  With my switch to a LCHF diet, I&#39;ve found burning fat to be a far superior source of fuel than carbohydrates and performing MAF shorter runs (less than 2.5 hours) on an empty stomach was hardly an effort. Long runs definitely needed a little bit of a LCHF breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So am I finished with MAF?  Not on your nelly.  I plan to continue with almost all of my training runs in future being within my MAF range.  I will however be introducing a change next year.  I think I now have quite a big aerobic base - it&#39;s nowhere near that of the elite and top club runners, but a heck of a lot closer than it used to be - so I&#39;m going to start introducing one fortnightly race-specific training session that really taxes me and trains my body for the race ahead.  I can&#39;t say I felt the need for any race-specific training last year, but given my times continued to improve through the year as I trained and raced more, I think it&#39;s worth a try.  Worst case scenario: I find they start to have a negative impact and I&#39;ll either reduce the frequency or drop them entirely.  One thing is for sure: the MAF training and the Sunday long runs will not be going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So if I have one bit of advice for runner it is to take some time out, read Phil Maffetone&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/Want_Speed_Slow_Down_2007.pdf&quot; title=&quot;A local copy of &#39;Want Speed? Slow Down&#39;&quot;&gt;Want Speed? Slow Down&lt;/a&gt; PDF and give the MAF method of training a go. It really works.  Try it exclusively for 3 months and see what happens to your running.  You&#39;ll be very surprised.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Merry Christmas 2012</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/merry-christmas-2012\"/>\n   <updated>2012-12-25T09:00:00+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/merry-christmas-2012</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Merry Christmas&quot; src=&quot;/assets/christmas.jpg&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;465&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Mid-run Ditch-water Shower</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/mid-run-ditch-water-shower\"/>\n   <updated>2012-12-24T14:07:17+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/mid-run-ditch-water-shower</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;A very merry f***ing Christmas goes out to the white van driver who thought I needed a ditch-water shower right in the middle of my run along the A4 outside Twyford today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You made absolutely no attempt to slow down or avoid the huge puddle.

They cost me about $140, which at the time worked out to about £88.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/vibram-five-finger-seeya&quot;&gt;Vibram Five Finger Seeyas&lt;/a&gt; to replace the Bikilas.  I&#39;ve now run 130km in the Seeyas and I think they&#39;ve bedded in well so I can now officially retire the Bikilas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the last 19 months I&#39;ve officially logged 1865km to the Bikilas. I&#39;ve run a lot more than that if we take into account warm-ups and cooldowns I&#39;ve not logged and of course walking around before and after runs and races, but as they&#39;re not officially logged, we&#39;ll ignore those additional kilometers and work with what I know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So what do a pair of Bilikas look like after 1865km? Pretty good, if you ignore these little annoyances...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Camera-Awesome-Photos/i-NxMn7CQ/0/L/CA_11151214591050-L.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/CA_11151214591050-S.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I can see daylight (1)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Camera-Awesome-Photos/i-cVKcSMd/0/L/CA_11151214591774-L.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/CA_11151214591774-S.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I can see daylight (2)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;I can see daylight&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... and only concentrate on the rest of the shoe ...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/CA_11151214580409-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vibram Five Finger Bikilas after 1865km (1)&quot; /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/CA_11151214581261-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ibram Five Finger Bikilas after 1865km (2)&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Vibram Five Finger Bikilas after 1865km&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Other than the holes and dirt (I&#39;ve not bothered washing them this close to retirement), they look pretty good. To be honest, the holes in the toes weren&#39;t causing me any bother though so I could easily have kept running in them until I wore through the ball of the foot, though that wouldn&#39;t be for much longer as the balls are very thin now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So as you can see, they&#39;ve held up pretty well, and I&#39;m certainly impressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&#39;ve titled this post &quot;Vibram Five Finger Bikilas are Very Cheap&quot; and they are... on a pence-per-kilometer scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1865km for £88 works out at 4.72 pence a kilometer.  That is incredibly cheap, especially when you consider most people retire their £80 shoes at about 500km (at a cost of 16p a kilometer) on the guidance of the their local running shop and publications like Runner&#39;s World. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So whilst I was reluctant to spend the money at first, I&#39;m glad I did.  I&#39;ve had a great time running in the Vibram Five Finger Bikilas and am so far loving the Seeyas and Spyridons I&#39;ve just got.  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll get quite as many kilometers on the Seeyas as they&#39;re much less of a shoe than the Bikilas, but I anticipate I&#39;ll get at least the same on the Spyridons.

After a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/new-garmin-or-refurb&quot;&gt;umming and aaahhhing about whether I should go the refurb route or buy a different watch&lt;/a&gt; (I thought about the Garmin Forerunner 610), I&#39;ve decided to go for the refurb.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;ll cost £78.30 vs £224 for a new Forerunner 610.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this watch I&#39;m sending back is a refurb replacement for this exact issue I experienced around about this time last year.  I think I&#39;m spotting a pattern here: the watch (either new or refurb) seems to develop a battery fault with about a year of constant use:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I purchased my original Garmin Forerunner 405CX on 26 January 2010.&lt;br /&gt;\nI contacted Garmin about the watch no longer holding charge on 12 January 2011.  They replaced it under warranty with a refurb.&lt;br /&gt;\nI contacted Garmin about the refurb developing the same problem yesterday, 22 November 2012&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is just my luck, we&#39;ll see.  Hopefully I don&#39;t have to write a similar post in 12-14 months from now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Holding thumbs the refurb will be with me before I head off to sunny South Africa for my holibobs, I&#39;m not holding my breath though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I&#39;ve just realised there is no pattern. Now I&#39;ve re-read this, I realised I got just under a year off the first watch and just under 2 for the second.  Hopefully I&#39;ll get closer to 3 for the 3rd &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">New Garmin Or Refurb?</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/new-garmin-or-refurb\"/>\n   <updated>2012-11-20T12:52:12+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/new-garmin-or-refurb</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Well, it would appear my second Garmin Forerunner 405CX has forgotten how to keep charge.

I worked out I&#39;d probably cover about 33-35km in that time.  I ended up covering just over 35km in 2 hours and 57 minutes - I&#39;d already tacked on a run round the block as I got back home way quicker than I anticipated, so didn&#39;t push things to get the final 3 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was a lovely run.  Not a cloud in the sky and thankfully very little traffic on the country roads I was running on.  One thing is for sure: I definitely over dressed for this run.  It was 2C when I left, so I dressed for it, only to find that the sun was very warming and I soon warmed up meaning I ended up running most of my run with the outer jacket wrapped round my waist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s run also took this week&#39;s &quot;kilometer-age&quot; over 100km.  My 5th 100km week of the year, and probably my last for the year.  I however plan to get in a lot more of these big weeks next year - I&#39;m thinking at least one a month.  We&#39;ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the sun is still shining, I have tired legs, so I think I&#39;ll spend the rest of the day on my bum drinking beer (after we&#39;ve popped to Sainsbury&#39;s for a little top-up grocery shop). Wonder if I can convince the Mrs to take me to the pub whilst we&#39;re out &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Vibram Five Fingers Seeya</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vibram-five-finger-seeya\"/>\n   <updated>2012-11-05T09:39:58+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vibram-five-finger-seeya</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;The posty came to see me again today to drop off my newest order...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/aa64b3ec272c11e298dc22000a1fc2d3_7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vibram Five Finger Seeya&quot; width=&quot;612&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Vibram Five Finger Seeya&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let me hear you all say &quot;Ooooooo&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These will now be my primary road shoe, though I think I might rotate them with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/vibram-five-fingers-spyridon&quot;&gt;Spyridons&lt;/a&gt;.

Normally I don&#39;t mind the rain and gauge if it&#39;s worth heading out by how hard it is raining and how wet I&#39;m likely to be at the end of my run. This morning I woke up to find it tipping down and worked out that I&#39;d be about 15 mins into my 2 hour run before I&#39;d have wet undies. No thanks. An hour and three quarters of training with soggy jocks is not my idea of fun and enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Think I&#39;ll wait until later in the day to see if it eases up.

When hunting around, I discovered the Maidenhead half, which seemed to tick all the boxes: it was flat, close to home, a half-marathon, 5 months after my last half, no clashes with other races and in an area I&#39;m familiar with.  So I entered the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now when I originally entered this race, the details of the route were unclear and I was under the impression they&#39;d use the same route as they did in 2011.  This wasn&#39;t the case and as we got closer to the event, I discovered the new route was a multi-lap race rather than the single lap route they used in 2011.  I&#39;m not a fan of multi-lap races, especially longer races, as I get a bit bored and a bit demotivated on the subsequent laps - I think I perform much better when I don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming.  But as I&#39;d already entered and you can&#39;t get refunds, I went ahead and ran it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Going into the race I had the idea of attempting to run it in about 80 mins.  According to my WAVA score for my other distances, this should be possible, especially as most of my training has been concentrating on longer runs.  So that&#39;s what I had in my mind as a goal for the race, though it wasn&#39;t a concrete goal as I&#39;d never gone that fast over 21.1km before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Race day came and it was a little on the cold side.  This is a good sign.  I definitely run quicker when it&#39;s cooler. My wife drove me to the race as she needed to take her dad to hospital, so we parked in the Sainsbury&#39;s carpark and headed to the town hall outside which the race was starting and finishing.  After a little milling around I soon worked out where the baggage drop-off point was, stripped down, queued (for a long time) and deposited my bag.  Due to the queue to hand in my bag I ended up having to cut my warm up short so managed to only squeeze in a 7 min warm up before making my way to the sub-90 min &quot;pen&quot;.  There weren&#39;t actual pens, but there were signs to give you an idea of where you should start in the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Maidenhead half-marathon 2012 route&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Maidenhead_half_route.png&quot; width=&quot;321&quot; height=&quot;422&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Maidenhead Half-marathon 2012 route&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At 9:30am we were sent on our way by Paralympic gold medalist &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Christiansen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sophie Christiansen&lt;/a&gt; (who now has a gold postbox on Maidenhead high street outside HSBC) and into the first bottle-neck of the race: the start/finish line.  The area behind the start of the race was the complete width of the street.  The start/finish line was not, so the moment the gun went off, everyone was funneled into a smaller gap in order to cross the start line.  As I was close to the front, there was only a little bit of elbowing, but I imagine it was terrible further back.  In less than 200m we were thrown onto the High Street with a sharp left.  Once again, it was a bit of a jostle and probably a bit of argy-bargy happening further back in the field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a quick loop round town, it was down past Waitrose and under the A4/Bridge Road using the pedestrian/cycle underpass.  Great idea I thought when I learnt of the route - &quot;this way they don&#39;t need to stop traffic on the A4&quot;.  However when I entered the underpass I realised this probably wasn&#39;t the best idea after all as Britain&#39;s underpasses have these lovely &quot;anti-cyclist&quot; barriers.  Essentially metal railings set staggered across the path on the ramps into and out of  the underpass that force cyclists to slow down. No problems for me as the field had thinned out nicely by the time I got to the underpass but definitely a problem when the masses come through.  These barriers would force everyone into single-file to zig-zag through them.  What&#39;s more, there was no warning these were coming so if you turned sharply out of the tunnel, you&#39;d run straight into the barriers.  You&#39;d have thought they&#39;d remove these knowing 2500-odd people would be streaming through this first tunnel within minutes of the race starting, but they didn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once we&#39;d negotiated the underpass and its barriers we had a little meander through the Ray Mead/Park before we joined Ray Mead road and headed for Cookham.  On entering Cookham, we cut up School Lane, joined the High Street, turned left into Maidenhead Road, followed this all the way back towards Maidenhead, turned left into Ray Mill Road West which then became Ray Mill Road East before joining Ray Mead Road again for the second lap.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I was sort of aiming for around 80 minutes, I set off at a good pace of around 3:46 to 3:48 a km and was chugging along beautifully with very little variation in pace.  Until about 14km, which is now well into the second lap, when I a) started to get a bit bored and b) I started to over-think things.  I was still feeling strong at 14km and was going well, but doubt crept into my mind.  I&#39;d never run this fast over 21.1km.  I&#39;d also not raced this far on a low-carb, high-fat diet and I started to think about the things that could go wrong like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_the_wall&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dreaded wall&lt;/a&gt; to making its appearance.  So as a result I slowed down to about 4:00 a km and settled in for this slightly slower pace waiting for something to go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With just over a kilometer to go, we turned into Kidwells Park for a loop round the back before using another underpass to go back under the A4 and join the high street and it was about here that I realised nothing was going to go wrong.  The wall wasn&#39;t going to make an appearance and I was on my way to a personal best for the half-marathon.  It wouldn&#39;t be under 80 mins, but it would certainly be a PB by about 5 mins, so I picked up the pace and flew to the finish, evening finding plenty of energy to out-sprint a chap on the last 100m to the finish line (&lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.sussexsportphotography.com/viewpicture.tlx?pictureid=12819442959&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;check this pic of me flying&lt;/a&gt;) in a gun time of 1:21:46.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During our run, the start area had been transformed into the finish area with tables setup containing cups of water and  probably the best thing I&#39;ve seen at the end of a race in a long time: boxes and boxes of perfectly ripe bananas.  What a brilliant idea, especially for a &lt;abbr title=&quot;low-carb, high-fat&quot;&gt;LCHF&lt;/abbr&gt; runner like me who is only going to reject, throw away or give away the usual sugary post-race choccie or &quot;sports bar&quot; often handed out at the end of races.   Note to other race organisers: get bananas, and lots of them &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, this is a good fast and very well organised race with some room for improvement, most notably the baggage drop-off and pick-up needs to be setup such that multiple queues can be used to drop-off and then pick-up the bags and something could be done to reduce the bottlenecks, barriers and sharp turns the underpasses introduce to the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepatchrunning.com/images/stories/purplepatchrunning/Races/PMHMResultsforweb2012v5.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official results&lt;/a&gt; were:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gun time: 1:21:46&lt;br /&gt;\nChip time: 1:21:40&lt;br /&gt;\nPosition: 47 / 1829&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Merrell Trail Gloves Again or Inov-8 Trailroc 235s</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/merrell-trail-gloves-again-or-inov-8-trailroc-235s\"/>\n   <updated>2012-10-25T11:44:14+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/merrell-trail-gloves-again-or-inov-8-trailroc-235s</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s time to get a new pair of offroad shoes and I&#39;m undecided as to whether I should stick with the Merrell Trail Gloves or try something new and go for the Inov-8 Trailroc 235s.

It was a clear crisp morning with loads of potential for a good time. I headed off probably a little fast (I went through 10k one second quicker than my all-time 10k PB) in an attempt to get a sub-80min half marathon. I knew I was capable of it, I just wanted to do it this season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- more --&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things went really well and my faster start meant I wasn&amp;#39;t too far off target after slowing due to the hills and sharp corners towards the end of the race. I still needed to sprint at the end to dip in under 80mins gun time, but that&amp;#39;s a small price to pay for a fab race and a new all-time PB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is only the second running of this race, so it can be forgiven for not quite getting everything right.  Whilst everything went well for me, I did spot several places for improvement:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; The baggage drop-off and pickup needs to be able to accommodate more than one queue.  It also needs to process people&amp;#39;s bags a lot quicker.  With 30mins to go to the start the queue was snaking all over the carpark and I calculated it would take at least 15-20mins for me to hand in my bag had I joined the queue, leaving me with very little time to warmup and get to the start.  Instead I opted to run the 5 mins back to my car and drop my back off there.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Don&amp;#39;t funnel everyone the moment you cross the start line.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Use flatter timing &amp;quot;mats&amp;quot;.  The timing ridges are very sudden and quite high. I didn&amp;#39;t experience too much of a problem as I knew what to expect before the start so I was actively looking out for a 3-5cm step, but given the start became very cramped due to the funneling, I&amp;#39;m sure many a person behind me tripped over or stumbled over the timing &amp;quot;ridges&amp;quot;.  The same thing applies to the finish straight.  Right when you legs are knackered, the last thing you want to do is hop, skip and jump over 3 hurdles on the finishing straight.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.racetimingsystems.com/public/result.aspx?raceid=2116&amp;amp;bib=590&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;\nGun time: 1:19:58&lt;br&gt;\nChip time: 1:19:53&lt;br&gt;\nPosition: 29 / 3032&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Should I be Running a 10k PB In a Half-Marathon?</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/should-i-be-running-a-10k-pb-in-a-half-marathon\"/>\n   <updated>2012-10-15T10:35:30+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/should-i-be-running-a-10k-pb-in-a-half-marathon</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I ran the Oxford Half-marathon and set a new all-time personal best (PB) for the half-marathon (more details coming in a later post) and I was just in the process of reviewing my &lt;a href=&quot;http://connect.garmin.com/activity/233229988&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;watch data&lt;/a&gt; when I noticed the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;10k PB in a Half-marathon&quot; src=&quot;/assets/10k_pb_in_21k.png&quot; width=&quot;260&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;I went through the 10k mark 1 second ahead of my all-time 10k PB time&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That folks is an all time PB for 10km for me, by one second, and it has occurred in the middle of a half-marathon.  Now I admit I started yesterday&#39;s run a little fast, but I don&#39;t think I did it that fast.  I guess I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It certainly means a sub-37 min 10km race is definitely on the cards next year.  Who knows, maybe I can dip below 36 mins.

Not every race was as well documented as Missoula’s, but wherever professional race photographers had been present he hunted for shots of Litton among other runners. He found images of him at the end of a course, only twice at the beginning, and never in between. And there was the chip-gun differential: with rare exceptions, Litton started two to five minutes behind the leaders.

Let me repeat: &lt;strong&gt;17:36!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;. I think this has to be an all time personal best.  I can&#39;t remember ever running 5km this fast, and what&#39;s more I&#39;ve done it off road on a grassy parkrun course, so who knows how much quicker I could be on a nice flat road 5k.  A little bit of me is disappointed: we&#39;re fast approaching the end of the season so I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to see how this translates over a nice fast flat 10k.  Sub-37min maybe?  We&#39;ll have to see next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For this year, I&#39;ve still got the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepatchrunning.com/races/pharmalink-maidenhead-half-marathon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maidenhead Half Marathon on 16 September&lt;/a&gt; and as this is a fast flat 2-lapper in an area I&#39;m very familiar with, today&#39;s 5k time could translate into an all-time half-marathon PB.

Given the route is mostly uphill for the first 3 km and has a &quot;sting-in-the-tail&quot; in the form of a slow incline and then a sharper short hill in the last 2km, I was a little apprehensive about achieving this goal, but I didn&#39;t let that put me off.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Results SMS Screenshot&quot; src=&quot;/assets/SMS-Screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;My last 3 Yateley 10k results SMSs&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of taking heed of the &quot;sting-in-the-tail&quot; and saving something for the end, I opted for the approach of getting ahead of myself by the time I got to the last 2km and hope I can keep the pace up. After a bit of a quick start, which felt far too easy, I settled into a comfortable pace and ticked over the kilometres aiming to keep my average time per km well under 3:48.  I pushed it a little more than I probably should have on the long downhill section and kept things pretty constant on the long flat between 5 and 8km.  This method worked a treat and up to this point, only 1km was slower than 3:48 - the 8th.  The 9th kilometre, as expected was much slower at 4:05, but thankfully not so slow I couldn&#39;t claw things back in the last kilometre.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On entering the field for the finish, I looked up and was pleased to see the time on the clock approaching 37:45. That sub-38 was well within my grasp. So I dug in and sprinted to the finish coming in in under 38 minutes, pipping a chap at the line who passed me during my slower 9th kilometre.  My watch said 37:57.  I&#39;d done it.  By the time I got back to my car, I&#39;d received my official result text message (right): gun time: 37:58 chip time: 37:55!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last night&#39;s performance a whopping 50 seconds of my previous 10k PB (&lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/racing-update&quot;&gt;38:45&lt;/a&gt;) and a huge 1 minute 56 seconds off my previous best for this race (39:51). The Yateley 10k is deemed a slightly tough race so I&#39;m very chuffed with myself for getting my first sub-38 10k in 14 years on this run.  It does make me think what kind of time could I get over a nice flat 10k route.  Think I&#39;ll have to see if I can find such a route and find out &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I can finally say I am a sub-38 minute 10k runner again.

I already had plans to head over to my in-laws today to go mow their lawn and thought as I&#39;m in the area, I&#39;ll to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/black-park/home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Black Park parkrun&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I got up as usual, made my wife some tea and made myself a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bulletproofexec.com/how-to-make-your-coffee-bulletproof-and-your-morning-too/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bulletproof coffee&lt;/a&gt; - yes it sounds weird and disgusting, but it is surprisingly tasty.  This was only my second bulletproof coffee and I wanted to see how well it and some fruit salad and yoghurt (breakfast) would fuel me for my run and into the morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/black-park/course&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;course description&lt;/a&gt;, it sounded like the Black Park parkrun would be an great run for a fast time, and fuelled by my bulletproof coffee and the vim, vigour and vitality I woke up with, I decided I&#39;d go for it today and see if I could get a new PB.  Well, as you can see from the title of this post, I did it, and by a whopping 21 seconds.  I set a new PB (by 4 seconds) of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/results/weeklyresults?runSeqNumber=145&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;18:29 at the Reading parkrun&lt;/a&gt; last week so was very surprised to find I&#39;d knocked such a huge chunk off this week.  I think that sub-18min 5k on a fast course like this is definitely on the cards and probably this year, especially as I had the legs to out sprint two guys over the final 200m to claim &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/black-park/results/weeklyresults?runSeqNumber=161&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;3rd spot (out of 284)&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;d actually spent the entire run exchanging 3rd and 4th place with the guy who ended up coming 5th (white shirt in the photo below) overall.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/gmardall/7661260758/&quot; title=&quot;20120728-IMG_3441.jpg by G Mardall, on Flickr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/7661260758_1328a9f385_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; alt=&quot;20120728-IMG_3441.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Final Sprint to the Finish - My shoelace came untied at around 3km &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The parkrun itself is lovely.  It is indeed flat and fast thanks to the compact paths, set in a lovely wooded park, but I think the best bit, and the part I prefer most, is the fact is a single 5k loop.  It is also a very well attended and well organised parkrun, and guess what, they have no marshalls on the route: just follow the little arrows.  If you don&#39;t see an arrow telling you to turn, don&#39;t turn.  Simple really.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and I&#39;m convinced: bulletproof coffee is definitely a tremendous fuel for running and fits in perfectly with my high fat, high protein, low carb diet.  On Wednesday evening, I&#39;ll see how well it goes with my other high fat, high protein, low carb pre-race snack: mixed nuts, which I plan to eat before running the Yately 10k.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">BBC Panorama: The Truth About Sports Products</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/bbc-panorama-the-truth-about-sports-products\"/>\n   <updated>2012-07-20T12:02:24+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/bbc-panorama-the-truth-about-sports-products</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;BBC1 broadcast an very interesting episode of Panorama last night...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; alt=&quot;Panorama&quot; src=&quot;/assets/panorama-sports.jpg&quot; width=&quot;272&quot; height=&quot;153&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Truth About Sports Products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As many of us try to get fitter in this Olympic summer, Panorama investigates the sports products that promise to boost your performance. Are those pricey trainers worth the money? Can sports drinks really help you work out for longer? Are protein shakes any more effective at honing the physique than ordinary food?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With exclusive access to the findings from a unique study by the British Medical Journal and Oxford University, reporter Shelley Jofre tests the science behind the bold advertising claims made by some of sport&#39;s biggest brands.&lt;br /&gt;\n— &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01l1yxk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Truth About Sports Products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A very interesting programme that concentrated on the marketing claims sports supplement, drink and shoe manufacturers make about how wonderful and amazing their products are and how they&#39;ll make you so much better at your sport, and the scientific evidence to support these claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can expect, pretty much everything lacked any relevant scientific backing to go with the sensational claims with some companies using very dubious studies to try and back their claims. Essentially the programme revealed that these companies have come up with very clever ways to make you, the average Joe Schmoe, pay a lot of money for sugar, salt and water and who knows what else without any real good reason.  These supplements and drinks have very little impact on the average person&#39;s performance and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They also covered the injury prevention claims made by running shoe manufacturers and, as a barefoot running fan, you&#39;ll know they came up with nothing.  To try and make a balanced argument, they mentioned barefoot running and even illustrated how running barefoot reduces impact and thus acknowledged &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/my-thoughts-on-the-lieberman-paper&quot;&gt;Daniel Lieberman&#39;s research&lt;/a&gt;. But then they turned things a bit against barefoot and minimalist running, as they did with normal running shoes, when they mentioned that Merrell also couldn&#39;t provide research proving that running in their minimalist shoes could substantiate their marketing claims.  This is a perfectly valid thing to do and good on them for doing it, but it did seem a bit hurried and &quot;matter-of-factly&quot; and seemed to neglect the fact that the barefoot running research is a lot newer and more relevant to Merrell&#39;s claims than anything out there for normal shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They did however summarise the running shoe debate by getting a scientist to basically say that until there is further research about the affects of various shoes (or not) on injury prevention, the best thing to do is buy a pair you are comfortable with and ignore all the marketing hype.  I couldn&#39;t agree more, though I&#39;d prefer it if you went for a pair of minimalist shoes or go completely barefoot &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of things made me smile in this rather serious programme.  First there was the revealing of an old world-class athlete&#39;s performance enhancing supplement: Graeme Obree showed us how to make a jam sandwich which he normally consumes with water. This and other proper foods are all the supplementation he ever used and supported by comments on other athletes doing the same today. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The second thing, and this really tickled me, was when the reporter asked Tim Noakes what the point of low calorie sports drinks is given these manufacturers claim you need the sugar and carbs etc to improve your performance.  Tim was clearly tickled by this too as they showed a section of filming indicating re-takes had to be taken as Tim couldn&#39;t control his laughing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the topic of Tim Noakes, I think this programme could have spent a lot more time interviewing Tim on the sports drinks topic.  He&#39;s a world renowned scientist in this regard and can be credited some very good studies on the topic of over-drinking and even taking on Gatorade and ultimately winning.  He&#39;s also just released a new book on the topic: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/145042497X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=145042497X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&quot;&gt;Waterlogged: The Serious Problem of Overhydration in Endurance Sports&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;ve not read this yet, but if it is anything like his coverage of this topic in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007KZS5OQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B007KZS5OQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&quot;&gt;Challenging Beliefs: Memoirs of a Career&lt;/a&gt;, it&#39;ll be a very good read.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re based in the UK or have access to a UK based proxy server, I recommend you watch this programme on BBC iPlayer.  It&#39;s a worthy use of an hour of your time and adds to my own growing beliefs, following years of experimenting on myself, that most of these products out there are a complete waste of time and money and they&#39;ll only make you fatter and poorer.  If you&#39;re not in the UK, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find a &quot;backup&quot; on the internet sometime soon &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">336km: A New Monthly Record</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/336km-a-new-monthly-record\"/>\n   <updated>2012-07-02T14:08:32+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/336km-a-new-monthly-record</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Last month was a bumper month for running for me.

Now how&#39;s that for a lot of running in a single month.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike my previous month, this month was pretty much exclusively running.  I didn&#39;t do any dedicated weights sessions or swimming as I find both of these impact my running more than I&#39;d like.  I might bring those back during the winter months when I don&#39;t always want to head outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So not only did &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/103km-in-one-week-a-new-record&quot;&gt;I run over 100km in a single week&lt;/a&gt; last month, I also set a new record for the highest mileage in a single month.  Great stuff and best of all I felt pretty good all month with the exception of the end of last week when I was feeling a little tired from a couple of late nights and some tough racing.

A New Record</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/103km-in-one-week-a-new-record\"/>\n   <updated>2012-06-17T09:36:01+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/103km-in-one-week-a-new-record</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of last week, I thought to myself: &quot;I wonder if I can do 100km of running in a week and at what point I&#39;d actually start to feel it&quot;.  Now I&#39;ve finished today&#39;s long run, I now know. YES I can, and not until the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In order to get to 100km I worked out I&#39;d have to average just over 12km a day for Monday to Saturday and then run somewhere between 22 and 25km for my long run.  As I didn&#39;t have a long run on Sunday last week, I decided on a slightly longer run on Monday (just over 16km) and then stuck to just over 12km a day for the rest of the week.  I was expecting to start to feel tired and slow as the week progressed, but I found this didn&#39;t happen.  I didn&#39;t feel tired and I actually started running my 12 or so kilometers quicker as the week progressed, whilst still keeping my heart rate in the desired range (148-153 BPM).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday and today have been the days when I&#39;ve finally felt I&#39;ve had a heavy week of training.  Yesterday I ran about 3.7km to the Reading parkrun as a warmup, &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/won-reading-parkrun&quot;&gt;ran and won the Reading parkrun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt; and then ran home again as a cooldown.  Today I ran just over 25km for my long run.  It was during the final 400m of the parkrun - my legs burnt when trying to break into a sprint into a very strong head wind - and the last 5km of today&#39;s long run that I actually felt a bit tired, but otherwise I felt great all week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those who like details, here&#39;s a screenshot of this week&#39;s training from Garmin Connect...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/103kmInAWeek.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;103km In A Week&quot; title=&quot;alt=&quot;103km In A Week&quot; src=&quot;/assets/103kmInAWeek.png&quot; width=&quot;889&quot; height=&quot;251&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Almost 104km in a week!! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever run this far in a single week. This week also takes me to 211km for the month so far.  I think my previous monthly best of 259km may just topple this month.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So will I do another 100km week again?  Almost certainly, but I think next time I&#39;ll split things down into a few more runs, maybe a double run on a Tuesday and Thursday.  When?  I&#39;m not sure, maybe the week after next.  We&#39;ll see how I feel, but now I know I can do it, I think it might become a regular event.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">I Won Reading parkrun This Morning</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/won-reading-parkrun\"/>\n   <updated>2012-06-16T09:49:08+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/won-reading-parkrun</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just won today&#39;s windy &amp; muddy Reading parkrun in what is probably one of the slowest winning times (18:50), but who cares.

This is my local race and a quick race too thanks to it being relatively flat for most of the race with a nice long downhill down Wokingham Road.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This year conditions were perfect and I went into the race with the goal of running a sub-39 minute race.  As I had such great success with the negative split in the Reading Half Marathon, I decided I&#39;d try it on the Woodley 10k too.  I started the race at a very modest pace and watched a lot of people race off ahead of me.  I started to get a little worried about this by about 2km, but I stuck to my guns and continued at the pace I was going.  It wasn&#39;t quite as slow as I&#39;d planned, but it wasn&#39;t anywhere near as fast as I felt I should be going.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started to pick the pace up at about 3km and soon realised it was a wise decision to hold off at the beginning as I started passing those that passed me right at the beginning.  I felt great and continued to pass people all the way to the finish with me passing a lot of people in the last 3km, which happens to include the only real hill in the whole race.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think I could probably have pushed things a little faster as I had sufficient left in the tank to break into a sprint for the last 100-odd meters (uphill on grass) and totally obliterate my current &quot;personal best since return&quot; (PBSR).  Prior to that race my PBSR stood at 39:42 obtained at &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-woodley-10k-2011&quot;&gt;last year&#39;s Woodley 10k&lt;/a&gt;.  I crossed the line at this year&#39;s Woodley 10k in a fantastic time of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsystems.co.uk/ss/results/athlete/?entId=SEYMO-DHLAM-COLNM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;38:45&lt;/a&gt;, smashing my previous time by a whopping 57 seconds!!!  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To say I was chuffed was an understatement.  I was thrilled to bits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;5k parkruns&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As part of my training, I&#39;ve decided that the occasional parkrun will be my speed sessions.  They&#39;re not very long, semi-formal, free and a great way to monitor my progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I ran my first parkrun for 2012 two weeks after the Reading Half marathon on 14 April and it was an OK run with me finishing in a modest time of 19:37.  This wasn&#39;t a brilliant run and I attribute this to being tired from the half marathon and due to the relatively low volume of training in March due to tapering for the half marathon (I think I was a little worried I&#39;d go into the race over trained and in retrospect I think I might have been slightly under trained).  Things were a little damp underfoot too. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a relatively high mileage week of training, I ran the Reading parkrun again a week later (21 Apr 2012) and this time ran a mere 2 seconds quicker (19:35), a far cry from my Reading parkrun personal best (PB) of 19:13, but certainly quicker than I was at this point last year. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Three more weeks of high mileage training and six days after the Woodley 10k, I ran the Reading parkrun again, with no real race plan other than to run by feel and to not look at my watch until I&#39;d finished.  I felt fantastic, ran well and smashed my previous parkrun PB by 13 seconds finishing bang on 19:00.  On discovering my finish time I was little disappointed I hadn&#39;t looked at my watch during the race as had I done so I could probably have dipped under 19 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Feeling great after the Woodley 10k and this last parkrun, and motivated by the evidence that my training was starting to pay off, I took a week off from parkrun (a few too many beers the Friday night before - my wife&#39;s colleagues&#39; fault), upped my training for the next two weeks and then raced the parkrun again this last Saturday (2 Jun 2012), once again going by feel, but this time I paid attention to my watch.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now this was a spectacular run.  I did something I don&#39;t normally do at the parkruns: I took a much longer than usual warm up run.  Normally I barely cover 1km during my warmup, this time I ran just short of 3km before the run.  I&#39;m not sure how much of an impact this had on my run, but I certainly felt great, and ran way better than expected. Are you ready for this?  I smashed my previous parkrun PB, set only two weeks earlier, by a whopping 27 seconds and finished in 18:33.  I couldn&#39;t believe it.  I&#39;d totally obliterated my previous time and I didn&#39;t feel like I was putting in that much more effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I got home and check my logs, I realised this was not only a parkrun PB, but also an all time off-road 5k PB by 2 seconds.  Unfortunately, I know this is definitely not my all time fastest 5k time as I&#39;ve run two sub-38 minute 10k&#39;s (when I was a teenager) and there is no way I could do those without running really quick 5k times.  Sadly, I don&#39;t have any records of these faster 5k times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all, racing so far this year has gone really well with 57 seconds knocked off my 10k PBSR, 40 seconds off my parkrun PB (since last year) and 2 seconds off my all time off-road 5k time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure yet what other races I&#39;ll be doing this year, but one thing is for sure: I&#39;ll be continuing my current training methods and have set myself some new goals to achieve this year.  Just holding thumbs now that I&#39;m one of the lucky people who get drawn from the ballot for the London Marathon next year; I definitely think I can do it and do it well.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Over 1000km So Far This Year</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/over-1000km-so-far-this-year\"/>\n   <updated>2012-06-07T13:24:05+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/over-1000km-so-far-this-year</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s 13km run takes me over 1000km for the year so far. 2012km for 2012 looks like an easy target at this rate.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Today&#39;s Run Will Be At Least 12km</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/todays-run-will-be-at-least-12km\"/>\n   <updated>2012-06-07T11:21:06+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/todays-run-will-be-at-least-12km</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s run will be at least 12km.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Outrun Death Itself</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/outrun-death-itself\"/>\n   <updated>2012-06-06T09:10:01+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/outrun-death-itself</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;xkcd: Outrun Death Itself&quot; src=&quot;/assets/xkcd-out_run_death.png&quot; width=&quot;655&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Training and Diet Update</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/training-and-diet-update\"/>\n   <updated>2012-06-03T12:45:33+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/training-and-diet-update</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a while since I last posted about my running so this is going to be a long summary post covering my recent training and diet.  I&#39;ll write another, probably shorter, post on racing after this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Training&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Training is going really well. I&#39;m continuing to run using the maximum aerobic function (MAF) principals written about by Phil Maffetone which I &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/maf-training-anyone&quot;&gt;questioned in September last year&lt;/a&gt;.  Based on the results I&#39;m seeing and the way I&#39;m feeling, I&#39;ll continue to train using these principals.  To recap, essentially I am doing all my training in a heart rate range of 148-153 BPM.  This is based on Phil Maffetone&#39;s calculation of taking 180 - your age ± 5 depending on experience.  This value would be the maximum heart rate you should train at.  I use this as my upper limit (153) and then allow myself 5 BPM below this for most of my training and essentially means all of my training is taking place below 70% of my maximum heart rate.  All runs are effectively long and slow.  No speed work, no intervals, no threshold runs, no race pace runs, no any other kind of training used on conventional training programmes you&#39;ll find in the plethora of books and magazines out there. The closest to any of these traditional training sessions I get is racing and parkruns, which I race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once in a while I&#39;ll throw in an anaerobic training day in which I&#39;ll do 6 to 8 short sprints followed by a full body bodyweight weights workout.  I&#39;ll document this in another post some time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So far this is proving to be a very good idea.  I&#39;m clocking up more kilometers in training than I ever have and I don&#39;t feel knackered.  I can easily, and generally do, run on average 10km a day, every day, without this having any negative impact on my racing or health.  I also throw in the occasional rest day when I feel I need it.  This last month of training seems to have seen me really get into my stride, so to speak.  I clocked up my third highest training month at 249km and set a new best on the most kilometers run in a week this week with 81.69km.  I&#39;m also likely to pass 1000km for the year next week.  All of this with no signs of overtraining and no signs of injury either, touch wood.  I attribute this to this much more relaxed training pace and my change in diet, more on the diet below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also introduced a change to the way I do my long runs after last week&#39;s and today&#39;s great runs.  Instead of doing most of the run in the 148-153 BPM range, I&#39;m running the first half with my heart range below 148 BPM and then the second half with it in the MAF range.  This has had the effect that I don&#39;t find the long runs as stressful as I&#39;m not fighting my watch (it beeps when I run outside the predefined HR range) for such a long time.  It also results in a more consistent pace over the whole run as I tire.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also experimenting with using compression socks/sleeves for post-race and post-long-run recovery.  The jury is still out on the effectiveness of this, but I&#39;ll keep experimenting to see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, most of this training has not been barefoot, but it has been in minimalist - in the traditional sense and not Runner&#39;s World&#39;s definition - shoes, namely a pair of Vibram Bikilas and a pair of Merrell Trail Gloves. Runner&#39;s World call these &quot;barefoot&quot; shoes (I really hate this misnomer).  This is primarily because I&#39;m wondering all over the show to try and get the mileage in so I don&#39;t know what kind of terrain I&#39;m likely to encounter on a day-to-day basis.  I also don&#39;t think the skin on my feet can handle running 10km and more day-in-day-out on tar.  I do still however go out once in a while barefoot to keep things real &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Back in March I decided I&#39;d start to follow a &quot;paleo lite&quot; &lt;del&gt;diet&lt;/del&gt; way of life to...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;see how this would affect my body, mood and general wellbeing,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;see if it would help my body cope with a skin condition I&#39;ve got,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;see if it would help me lose a bit more weight - I&#39;d stabilised at about 79kg, and &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;because all the information I&#39;d read into the reasons behind adopting this way of life just seemed to make sense.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the curious, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paleo (short for paleolithic) diet&lt;/a&gt; is essentially a diet devoid of all grains (wheat, barley, rice, corn etc), legumes, potatoes, dairy products, salt, refined sugar, and processed oils. Instead concentrating on fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, eggs and nuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve opted for a &quot;lite&quot; version as I&#39;m not excluding salt, dairy products (in fact I&#39;ve upped my consumption of high fat dairy products) and I regularly (normally no more than once or twice a week) include &quot;if you must&quot; items like sweet potatoes, high cocoa chocolate and olive oil in my diet for variety. I sometimes use honey as a sweetener when I fancy a bit of sweetness in my coffee.  Beer and wine are also not banned on my version, but I don&#39;t drink that much anyway. I also stray away from the paleo diet before a race of 10km or longer to give myself a slight carbo-load, in which I&#39;ll eat a bit of bread, pasta or potatoes on the night or two before the race and a bowl of oats on the morning of the run.  I also like a bowl of fruit and nut packed muesli before my long runs.  Oh yes, and once in a while we&#39;ll go out for dinner in which case I&#39;ll try to keep a paleo as possible, but I don&#39;t beat myself up about it - this isn&#39;t a weekly event anyway so won&#39;t cause any damage. Otherwise day-to-day eating is pretty much consistent with the paleo diet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The results?  Well, I&#39;m loving it.  My training is not suffering one bit and in fact I think my ability to keep training as much as I am is partly due to the change in diet. The MAF training primarily relies on burning fat for energy so having it needs a big place in my diet. I&#39;ve lost 4kg and am now at what I think is my ideal weight of 75kg (I&#39;m 183cm/6 feet tall). My skin condition has definitely improved to the point I no longer need to use any creams as I don&#39;t get the flare-ups anymore. I no longer get grumpy and snappy when I haven&#39;t eaten for a while - this was a major problem when my wife and I would go out on a Saturday morning - and I no longer get that 4pm &quot;I really fancy a choccie bar&quot; slump.  The grazing on high protein (and fat) meat, oily fish, lots of fruit, vegetables and nuts and high fat dairy has really stabilised my blood sugar levels and has definitely resulted in an overall improvement in my life.  It&#39;s a little more expensive than the previous dependency on bulky carbs, but it&#39;s definitely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in the &quot;paleo lite&quot; way of life, have a look at the mountains of information at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marksdailyapple.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mark&#39;s Daily Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all from a training and diet perspective, I think I&#39;ve found a perfect balance for me and it is working wonders.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever go back to the traditional way of training with a high reliance on chronic cardio and anaerobic training programmes.  I&#39;ll also try my damnedest to never go back to a high carb diet.  The more I read the research on the negative impact of a low fat, high carb diet, the more I&#39;m convinced society has been following the wrong guidelines for a long long time.  Of course, I will change things if something starts to go wrong, but I don&#39;t think it will.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Run Fat B!tch Run</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/run-fat-btch-run\"/>\n   <updated>2012-04-21T18:58:07+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/run-fat-btch-run</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Saw a great book in WH Smiths today...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/184744542X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=184744542X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Run Fat B!tch Run&quot; src=&quot;/assets/runfatbithrun.jpg&quot; width=&quot;261&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what the book is about other than it&#39;s about encouraging fat ladies to lose weight by running, but the title caught my attention and made me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Sound Advice from the Virgin London Marathon Organisers</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/sound-advice-from-the-virgin-london-marathon-organisers\"/>\n   <updated>2012-04-17T11:20:59+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/sound-advice-from-the-virgin-london-marathon-organisers</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Sound advice from the Virgin London Marathon organisers in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.london-marathon.co.uk/uploads/marathon-centre/Online-Final-Instructions-2012.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Final Instructions (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; on page 9 ...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Don&#39;t Wee In Peoples Gardens&quot; src=&quot;/assets/DontWeeInPeoplesGardens.png&quot; width=&quot;264&quot; height=&quot;501&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... but by all means wee in people&#39;s gardens elsewhere &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Inov-8 Bare-X 180 Minimalist Shoes Look Good</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/inov-8-bare-x-180-minimalist-shoes-look-good\"/>\n   <updated>2012-04-16T17:14:15+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/inov-8-bare-x-180-minimalist-shoes-look-good</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I was browsing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wiggle.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wiggle&lt;/a&gt; the other day and happened across these rather attractive looking, from an aesthetic and spec perspective, minimalist running shoes from Inov-8...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Inov-8 Bare X 180&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Inov-8_Bare_X_180.jpg&quot; width=&quot;521&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Product-View-BareX-180.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inov-8 Bare-X 180&lt;/a&gt; shoes (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wiggle.co.uk/inov-8-bare-x-180-shoes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here on Wiggle&lt;/a&gt;), and they&#39;re a minimalist shoe with a zero-drop, no insole and only 3mm worth of rubber between your feet and the ground below.

This was a bit of a gamble as I&#39;d never heard anyone train like this before and had certainly never taken this approach myself. Seeing as I hadn&#39;t done a half marathon in a while, I thought &quot;&lt;em&gt;What the heck.  It&#39;ll be an interesting experiment. Worst case scenario, I blow it.  Best case, I finish the race strong and get the sub-90 minute finish time I&#39;d be aiming for&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWell, Sunday morning arrived and it was a glorious morning.  The sun was shining, the temperature was perfect and my wife and I hopped on our bikes and took a gentle cycle to the Madejski stadium.  As it&#39;s only 6.5km away from home I opted to cycle to and from the race rather than fight with the crowds on the shuttle buses or pay for parking.  This proved to be a very wise choice as there were way more people about than I was expecting.  It also proved to be a very good warm up, so once at the stadium, I only had a short little run to do and some dynamic stretching before making my way to the start of the race.  The 30 mins I&#39;d given myself for this turned out to be plenty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite this being my first half marathon in over 13 years, I didn&#39;t go for a &quot;wing it and see&quot; approach.  I actually devised a race strategy. In order to get the sub-90 minute time I was aiming for, I decided on running a negative split, that is run the first half slower than the second.  Then I went a step further and broke the race up into three 7km chunks with the aim of running each 7km chunk in a progressively faster time. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a little bit of time with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/calculators&quot;&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt;, I came with the following splits I&#39;d aim to run for each 7km:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0 - 7km: 31:30 which is 4:30/km&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\nPlenty slow enough to deal with the first hill and the inevitable slow start caused by the sheer number of runners.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 - 14km: 30:00 which is 4:17/km&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\nThis is slightly slower than the pace I&#39;d have to have sustained if I ran a constant pace for a sub-90.  I actually planned to run this leg at about 4:16/km, the required pace, just to be safe. 30mins was an easy number to remember.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 - 21km: 28:30 which is 4:04/km&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\nThis is quite a fast pace, but I thought I could do it, especially if my middle 7 turned out as I&#39;d hoped and took me less than 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now those with an eye for maths will notice this takes me to 90mins for 21km and a half-marathon is 21.1km.  Well, this was all about ease of calculation whilst on the run and with the final 100m being left out of the equation I knew I could always run like a man possessed for 100m at the end if need be &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; . I would however run the last 7km with the last 100m in mind anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this three-way split is it would give me a good way of assessing my pace and race in conjunction with how I felt at each point of the race and I could then make any changes as I felt fit, whilst also running a negative split.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As it so happens, my planning turned out brilliantly.  At just after 10am we were all sent on our way.  I was quite far from the start line so didn&#39;t hear the gun but registered we were off when the announcer said &quot;And they&#39;re off&quot; (about 15 seconds after starting the race).   It took me about 1 minute 15 seconds to cross the line and then I was off in the middle of a sea of people for our 21.1km around Reading.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things start off very slowly due to the sheer number of people ahead of me, but things soon started thinning out a bit, but not much, just after the 3km.  I was feeling great, enjoying the crowds and great weather and my legs just ticked over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I went through the first 7km just behind schedule in 31:36 (watch time, not gun or chip time).  Not bad at all considering there were way more people than I anticipated, congestion was quite bad at the beginning and the steepest climb fell within this period.  Happy with this and happy with the fact I was still feeling good, I picked up the pace a bit and ticked over the next 7km in 29:09 (1:00:45), going through the 10km mark in a chip time of 43:30.   A bit quicker than I&#39;d planned but I wasn&#39;t too concerned as this leg included a fair bit of downhill running and I was still feeling great.  Happy with my second leg and a bit ahead of schedule, I stepped the pace up a bit and headed for the finish line.  This last 7km was thankfully quite flat and I think it definitely helped that I knew exactly where I still had to run before getting to the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With just over 2km to go we turned back into Greenpark back onto the road on which we started for a little hair-pin loop before heading into the stadium.  It was about half way up the inbound part of the hair-pin that I saw the 1:30 (90 mins) chip time pacer for the first time since the start of the race and he shouted out that we still had a chance to catch him and dip under 90mins for the run.  I took that as a challenge and dug in deep.  I wanted to catch and pass him.  So far I was more or less on track for a sub-90, but I knew if I passed him, I&#39;d definitely do it.  It was at this point I started to feel a little tired, but I ignored those feelings and pushed on and passed the pacer on Shooters Way with about 200m to go and I just kept going.  That last 7km segment ended up being only slightly faster than the one before taking me 29:01 (1:29:46) and I entered the stadium and sped my way to the finish line, crossing in a gun time of 1:31:19.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was very happy with this time.  I&#39;d almost dipped below 90 mins for a gun time on a huge race.  Knowing that it took me somewhere between 75 and 90 seconds to cross the start line, I was quite confident I&#39;d dipped under 90 mins for my chip time, especially as I passed the pacer, but not overly so as I knew it would be close. I&#39;d have to wait for the official results to get my chip time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I did the goodie bag and medal walk through and met my wife outside the stadium.  I then went for a very short and gentle cool down run.  I ended up cutting this short as my calves were starting to cramp so instead we jumped on our bikes and headed into town for lunch.  I thought it only appropriate to take my wife out for lunch after she sat reading her Kindle in the sun in the stadium waiting for me.  This cycle into town and then ultimately on to home ended up being a great cool down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That evening I checked the race results and found this...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/MizunoReadingHalfMarathon2012Results.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Mizuno Reading Half Marathon 2012 Results - 1:29:52&quot; src=&quot;/assets/MizunoReadingHalfMarathon2012Results.png&quot; width=&quot;962&quot; height=&quot;261&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:29:52&lt;/strong&gt; !!! Yes!!!! I&#39;d done it. My racing strategy had worked perfectly, and it&#39;s just as well I didn&#39;t stick to it too closely as I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have crept under 90 mins if my middle leg had been slower.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My final position was 731 out of 13104 finishers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Job done and in my Vibram Five Fingers.  I&#39;m back to running half marathons and I&#39;ve gone under the 90 minute mark.  Now I&#39;ve done it, it should be easier to do it again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My 5k split times...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5K: 00:22:15&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;10K: 00:43:30&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;15K: 01:04:54&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;20K: 01:25:26&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... lead me to believe I have a sub-19 5k, sub-39 10k and sub-60 15k in my legs this season and I think I&#39;ll be using these as my goals for this season.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and just before leaving the race village, I couldn&#39;t help but leave my mark...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/TopSpotReadingHalf.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot; Top Spot at the Reading Half Marathon&quot; src=&quot;/assets/TopSpotReadingHalf.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;951&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&#39;t resist grabbing the top spot at the Reading Half Marathon &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite not actually getting my race number and T-shirt in the post (I&#39;m doubtful it was even sent), this was a great race, a great route and made better by some great weather.

We get up at insane hours of the morning to run insane distances on an almost daily basis.  Along with this comes all the banter about these shoes, that injury, and the next best running gadget or race you must run.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Recently talk has turned to barefoot and minimalist running and along with it a whole new topic of discussion for those long Sunday runs. As with anything new or different, you always get the &quot;experts&quot; and those who get a bit over enthusiastic and this is what Steven Sashen of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.invisibleshoe.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Invisible Shoes&lt;/a&gt; has capitalised on for this first video, &quot;Sh*t Barefoot Runners Say&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/NPdb7ZDJKS4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&#39;s also the flip side, which Steven has just captured in his sequel... &quot;Sh*t Runners Say to Barefoot Runners&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/erorsuyJKiQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve said any of the things in the first, but I&#39;ve definitely been the recipient of many of the comments in the second.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Tim Noakes: &amp;quot;If you&#39;ve got Lore of Running, tear out the section on nutrition&amp;quot;</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tim-noakes-if-youve-got-lore-of-running-tear-out-the-section-on-nutrition\"/>\n   <updated>2012-02-02T14:35:37+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tim-noakes-if-youve-got-lore-of-running-tear-out-the-section-on-nutrition</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m slowly working my way through Phil Maffetone&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1616080655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1616080655&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing&lt;/a&gt; and I must say it&#39;s quite a varied read.  One topic I&#39;ve just finished reading is about carbohydrate intolerance. &lt;a href=&quot;http://philmaffetone.com/2weektest.cfm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Carbohydrate Intolerance and the Two-Week Test&lt;/a&gt; gives a good idea what the chapter is about, though this post doesn&#39;t go into the performance affecting aspects like the book does.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve read on numerous occasions, and with ever increasing regularity now, about how maybe we&#39;ve got it all wrong and we really shouldn&#39;t be consuming anywhere near the level of carbs that we do, but this is the first time I&#39;ve actually seen anyone correlate common aches and pains with our carbohydrate rich diets.  This is quite an interesting topic, which I&#39;m eager to test, especially if it&#39;ll have a positive impact on my overall health and running performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nA couple of days after reading this chapter, I happened to notice a few people mention Tim Noakes and his new low-carb diet on Twitter.  Apparently Tim has been talking quite a bit about his new found confidence in high protein and fat diets.  Recently, he&#39;s given a talk for Runner&#39;s World ZA, written articles for numerous publications (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.discovery.co.za/email_za/mailers/pdfs/general/noakes.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Discovery Newsletter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.modernathlete.co.za/index_features.asp?ArticleID=788&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Modern Athlete&lt;/a&gt; and Southern Suburbs Tatler - I can&#39;t find this article, but it&#39;s discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.health24.com/dietnfood/Diet_basics/15-1168-1173,66523.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and was also interviewed on a top talk show station in South Africa: Radio 702 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://zebra.bookslive.co.za/blog/2012/01/24/podcast-tim-noakes-says-athletes-should-not-always-carbo-load/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;listen to it here&lt;/a&gt;) in which he puts his hands up and says he got it wrong all those years ago. After some self-experimentation, he now believes we really should not be consuming anywhere near as many carbs as we&#39;ve previously been advised by him and many other scientists, and instead we should be consuming high levels of protein and fat. In other words, there&#39;s some truth to the apparent madness that is the Atkins Diet.  He even goes on to say &quot;&lt;em&gt;If you&#39;ve got Lore of Running, tear out the section on nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&quot; because he no longer believes this information is correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The second edition of his autobiography, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1770221468/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1770221468&quot;&gt;Challenging Beliefs: Memoirs of a Career&lt;/a&gt;, due out in May, will go into more detail about his change of view.  I&#39;ve added it to my Kindle wishlist and will definitely be purchasing this when the 2nd edition becomes available.  Until then, Tim recommends people read Gary Taubes’s books: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1400033462/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1400033462&quot;&gt;Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0307474259/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0307474259&quot;&gt;Why We Get Fat: And What to Do about It (Vintage)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1444710338/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1444710338&quot;&gt;The Dukan Diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve always admired Tim Noakes for his expertise and now even more so.  It takes a certain kind of person to put their hands up and say they got it wrong on a topic they&#39;ve been promoting for years.  You&#39;ve really got to admire Tim Noakes for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Time to dig out that old copy of the Atkins Diet sitting on our bookcase.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">259km: A New Monthly Record</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/259km-a-new-monthly-record\"/>\n   <updated>2012-02-01T11:01:16+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/259km-a-new-monthly-record</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#39;s run saw me log my highest monthly mileage total of 259km...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Screenshots/i-J4GvnXJ/0/X2/Jan-2012-Training-X2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Jan-2012-Training-M.png&quot; alt=&quot;I ran 259km in January 2012&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;I ran 259km in January 2012&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My previous high was 252km in November 2011.  Now the fact these two are quite close to each other - we could say right after each other as December doesn&#39;t really count as I was on holiday for most of the month - is no coincidence.  Since September I&#39;ve been experimenting with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/maf-training-anyone&quot;&gt;Maximum Aerobic Function (MAF)&lt;/a&gt; training as promoted/devised by Phil Maffetone and I&#39;m really enjoying it and starting to see results.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially all my training is just a lot of long and slow running done at a specific heart rate. No interval workouts, no threshold runs, no tempo runs, no racing, no anything-that-would-over-stress-the-body running.  I&#39;m finding that I feel moderately tired after a long run, but not absolutely knackered. Best of all, I feel great the next day and I can easily take another long run without feeling the strain. Case in point, on 22 January I ran my longest long run in a very very long time (just over 22km in 2 hours) and I felt great the next day and ran just over 9.5km that day. If so inclined, I could probably easily run two moderately long runs in a day if I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;ve also found a good training routine/pattern that my body seems to like: three high mileage weeks each with 5-6 runs, one of which is a long run, and one swimming session followed by one week low mileage with a swim.  I&#39;ve dropped the weight lifting sessions as I actually feel more knackered after these than after a long run. I now have Phil Maffetone&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1616080655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1616080655&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing&lt;/a&gt; and in here he recommends no weight training take place during the base building phase.  Now I have the book, I&#39;m also starting to do the monthly MAF tests properly, so we&#39;ll see in a couple of months exactly how much improvement I&#39;m getting from this long-slow running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all, I&#39;m really enjoying my running at the moment and I think I might be in for a bumper year in terms of mileage.  Lets just hope the race times plummet too.  The first test will be the Reading half-marathon on 1 April.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">It&#39;s Official: Barefoot IS Best</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/its-official-barefoot-is-best\"/>\n   <updated>2012-01-12T17:25:08+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/its-official-barefoot-is-best</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Barefoot is Best&quot; src=&quot;/assets/barefoot_is_best.jpg&quot; width=&quot;464&quot; height=&quot;249&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is now official, barefoot is best.

Approximately 74% of runners experienced a moderate or severe injury each year, but those who habitually rearfoot strike had approximately twice the rate of repetitive stress injuries than individuals who habitually forefoot strike. Traumatic injury rates were not significantly different between the two groups. A generalized linear model showed that strike type, sex, race distance, and average miles per week each correlate significantly (p&lt;0.01) with repetitive injury rates.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Competitive cross country runners on a college team incur high injury rates, but runners who habitually rearfoot strike have significantly higher rates of repetitive stress injury than those who mostly forefoot strike. This study does not test the causal bases for this general difference. One hypothesis, which requires further research, is that the absence of a marked impact peak in the ground reaction force during a forefoot strike compared to a rearfoot strike may contribute to lower rates of injuries in habitual forefoot strikers.\r\n\r\n(C)2012The American College of Sports Medicine&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/publishahead/Foot_Strike_and_Injury_Rates_in_Endurance_Runners_.98750.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Foot Strike and Injury Rates in Endurance Runners: a retrospective study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The sample size isn&#39;t very big and it doesn&#39;t conclusively prove barefoot it better than shod running - barefoot isn&#39;t even mentioned - but if they can come to their conclusion from such a small sample, we can further extrapolate to say barefoot has got to be better as you will almost certainly land on your forefoot when running barefoot.

It&#39;d been a very very very long time since I last ran in South Africa, let alone raced, and from the one other run I&#39;d had in Jo&#39;burg during my hols, a gentle 10k, I knew it would be a toughie.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So nice and early on Christmas eve, I bundled my wife into the car and we headed down to Delta Park for a quick spin round the park (me - my wife doesn&#39;t run). We got there with about half an hour to spare so I could warm up and introduce myself to the organiser - the one and only, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Fordyce&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bruce Fordyce&lt;/a&gt;. During the intros it came to light there were quite a few of us &quot;foreign&quot; bods there. There was me, another chap from Cambridge (also a Saffer) and 3 Kiwis, all doing our first SA parkrun. It was also a much larger turn out than expected with 24 people, which isn&#39;t bad considering up until that point the record had been 31 with absolutely no publicity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Around about 9am we all gathered for a photo...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/6573467975_a2f8b5f33d_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Delta Park Parkrun - 24 December 2011&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;The skinny guy to my left blitzed round in 17:10&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... and set off for what is probably the toughest parkrun you&#39;ll encounter.  Due to Delta Park&#39;s location and the general geography of Johannesburg, hills are unavoidable, and boy is this a hilly run.  Thankfully it&#39;s only a single-lapper (I prefer single lap runs) scenic run with a good mix of trails, grass and tar.  I&#39;ve only done the Reading and the Delta Park parkruns (note to self: I really must aim to do other parkruns this year) and I definitely prefer the Delta Park run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A combination of the altitude, hills and varied terrain saw me finish in 7th place in a rather slow time of 21:43. You&#39;d be amazed how much of an impact altitude has on your running performance - it&#39;s really hard work running at about 1600m above sea level, especially up hill, after only training at sea level for several years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, things didn&#39;t go well for everyone...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Aristotle was correct or perhaps it&#39;s because we South Africans are still bitter about the rugby World Cup but we somehow contrived to welcome our All Black friends by planting a snake (suspected Rinkhals- spitting cobra) in the first 300 metres of open grassland. A few minutes after we had set off Kelly hobbled back with a bite above her ankle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kelly was rushed off to hospital where she was treated and discharged a couple of hours later. The doctors were not entirely convinced that she had suffered a snake bite-. And we comforted ourselves by remembering that many venomous snakes are extremely reluctant to exhaust their poison in defense  prefering to save venom for their prey.

I&#39;ve not run any races, but I can see the positive effects as I cover more distance in the same amount of time at lower heart rates - I&#39;m currently doing lots of long slow runs using a bastardized version of the training ideas in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tricoachjill.com/page/page/4110957.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this HADD Article&lt;/a&gt; which I discovered when investigating the merits of &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/maf-training-anyone&quot;&gt;MAF training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As this is going well, I started to umm and aahhh about stepping things up a bit and started putting some serious thought into running a half-marathon.  I&#39;ve not run a half-marathon in well over 13 years and I finally feel my training is up to a point where I can complete a half-marathon, and in a pretty competitive time (ie sub-90 mins).  I wasn&#39;t sure if I should do the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wokinghamhalfmarathon.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wokingham half&lt;/a&gt; in February, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readinghalfmarathon.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reading half&lt;/a&gt; in April or both.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, after a lot of umming and ahhhing, I&#39;ve finally taken the plunge and entered next year&#39;s Reading half.  Whilst I think I could probably comfortably do both the Wokingham and Reading halves, I think it&#39;s probably best to take things slowly and enter only one that early in the year.  The Reading half is the larger of the two, so I&#39;ve opted for that one.  Maybe 2013 will see me do both.  We&#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That said, running the Reading half-marathon is expensive.  The entry fee is £31.50 for an affiliated athlete and £2 more for unaffiliated.  As a friend pointed out on Facebook, it&#39;s cheaper to catch the train!!!  The Wokingham half is only £18 for an affiliated athlete.  I hope the medal is huge and goodie bag is full of stuff that justifies the £13.50 premium.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">barefootrunner.co.uk Has a Nice New Look</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefootrunnercouk-has-a-nice-new-look\"/>\n   <updated>2011-11-29T16:08:42+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefootrunnercouk-has-a-nice-new-look</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Yes folks, it&#39;s time again for a new coat of paint on this website.

I&#39;ve plotted a route on Google Maps on several occasions and it appeared do-able, but never actually tried it, until today &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last week I noticed them doing some severe mowing over on that side of the river so today I thought I&#39;d go see if I could run right round and answer that question...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Can you run round the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After today&#39;s run, I can say: YES. Yes you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; run round the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake.  Look, I did it (switch to the Google Satellite view to get the most accurate data):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;465&quot; height=&quot;548&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://connect.garmin.com:80/activity/embed/130800271&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Would you want to run round the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Probably not.  It&#39;s not the easiest of runs. There&#39;s also one major hurdle to get over, but I&#39;ll get on to that in a moment.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the above route, I started at the David Lloyd gym and headed downstream along the Thames to Sonning, crossed Sonning bridge, diced with death for a little while before cutting into Sonning Eye.  I then followed the signs and road for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readingsc.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reading Sailing Club&lt;/a&gt;.  Once there, I continued straight through their car park and out the outside.  Up until this point, things were pretty easy.  Nice smooth flat paths and gravel roads.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once through the sailing club car park, I followed a foot path which got progressively narrow and harder to follow.  After a little detour and a short stumble through some nettles up to my waist, I back-tracked a bit and started following a path along the shore line.  Soon this too started to narrow and fade and on several occasions I found myself stopping to locate the path again.  After a couple more minutes of running, the I got the distinct feeling the paths were no longer from human traffic, but more likely wildlife traffic as I found myself ducking under low branches and leaping over thorny bushes.  I also ran through shoulder high reeds, still following a path, until eventually I ran out of land.  I&#39;d followed the shore of the main lake and rounded a small lake being fed by the larger lake.  Two ankle deep wading steps were called for and I was back on my way along a path.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a little more rambling and fighting for a path, I entered a very large opening which had recently been mown.  From here onwards things were pretty easy going and I started getting quite cocky with myself thinking I could come along with a machete and clear away the tougher bits of the path I&#39;d just covered and this could be a regular route.  I also secretly hoped they&#39;d mow this bit I was running across regularly.  Soon I found myself on the lovely smooth tarred section that runs along the north side of the rowing lake heading towards the clubhouse and my route out onto the road and back to the gym.  And then I encountered my major hurdle: an 8 foot high green metal fence with pointy bits on top.  Yes folks, the Oxfordshire side of the rowing lake is all fenced in with no pedestrian gates and the only gate out being the electric one by the clubhouse, which required a pin code. Oh poooh!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I doubled back on myself and ran back along the rowing path to see if I could find a convenient place to scale the fence.  No luck.  That&#39;s one high fence, and given the spikes on the fence and the brambles and other wild vegetation on either side, I didn&#39;t want to risk clambering over in my wet shoes.  So cap-in-hand I went back to the club house, ventured in, surprised a very friendly man in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britishrowing.org/gb-rowing-team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Team GB&lt;/a&gt; tracksuit, explained how I got in and asked if he could let me out.  Surprised by how I got in, the man kindly let me out and I was on my way.  I felt like a captive bird set free.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I then foolishly thought I spotted a shortcut back, which turned out not to be and soon found myself heading back towards where I&#39;d come from.  Thankfully, this time the fence next to me was only waist high, so I jumped that and diced with death back to Sonning Eye; running head-on into traffic on narrow roads without any pavements is pretty daunting.  Once in Sonning Eye, it was plain sailing back to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;So, would I do it again?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Definitely not.  I enjoyed by run today, but I don&#39;t think the rowing peeps will be too happy with me repeatedly asking to be let out like a puppy needing a wee.  I also don&#39;t think my legs can handle too many scratching sessions like today&#39;s and I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be whacking a convenient path for me anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So there you have it folks... if you&#39;ve run along the Thames and wondered if you could run round the Redgrade Pinsent rowing lake, I can proudly say you can, but you probably don&#39;t want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">It&#39;s Super Mario, I Mean, Fetchpoint Time!!!</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/its-super-mario-time\"/>\n   <updated>2011-11-18T15:58:08+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/its-super-mario-time</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fetchpoint&quot; src=&quot;/assets/fetchpoint_banner.jpg&quot; width=&quot;795&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last weekend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fetcheveryone&lt;/a&gt; released a new game - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/game-fetchpoint.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fetchpoint&lt;/a&gt; - and I think I&#39;m becoming a bit of a coin-collecting addict, and the game is only in &quot;test mode&quot;.  The official go-live is not until January.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what is Fetchpoint and how does it relate to running?&quot; I hear you ask.  Well, the whole concept of the game is you collect credits by running, walking, swimming, hopping, skipping and jumping or any other form of activity that can be deemed exercise and for which you can log an entry on Fetch and generate a route, either manually or via GPS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you run around your &#39;hood, you collect points and get docked points depending on which marker you run through (you technically only need to get within 80m of it).  At this early state, these are the markers and their descriptions from the Game Guide:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fetchpoint Markers&quot; src=&quot;/assets/markers.png&quot; width=&quot;514&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently, more markers will be added as the game evolves. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the 6 days since this was launched I&#39;ve kind of neglected the other game I was playing (Conquercise) in favour of running a lot closer to home or work on some very weird and strange winding routes.  I&#39;m also not entirely sure how the scoring works as I seem to jump huge numbers each day.  Today, for example, I jumped from about 7000 points to well over 11200.  Yes, the 12.5km route was a windy coin-collecting session through some neighbourhoods I&#39;d never been through and probably never will again (lets just say I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t dark), but never expected to collect over 4000 credits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think Fetchpoint really appeals to my competitive nature as not only do I see my monthly and annual mileage total increase after each run, but I also see my credits rocketing too.  Now if only I could convert those to cash &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, all this coin collecting has put the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiAxiGZKpGQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Super Mario Brothers game music&lt;/a&gt; and sound effects in my head during several runs now, and I regularly get the urge to jump at random points in my run.  Have a listen for yourself and if you go out coin-collecting, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll pop into your head too.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">100-Up Looks Vaguely Familiar</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/100-up-looks-vaguely-familiar\"/>\n   <updated>2011-11-14T16:18:47+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/100-up-looks-vaguely-familiar</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago Chris McDougall caused another little stir in the barefoot/minimalist running world with an article for The New York Times entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/magazine/running-christopher-mcdougall.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Once and Future Way to Run&lt;/a&gt;.  Within this article he mentions something called the 100-Up exercise...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I may have found it. I was leafing through the back of an out-of-print book, a collection of runners’ biographies called “The Five Kings of Distance,” when I came across a three-page essay from 1908 titled “W. G. George’s Own Account From the 100-Up Exercise.” According to legend, this single drill turned a 16-year-old with almost no running experience into the foremost racer of his day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I read George’s words: “By its constant practice and regular use alone, I have myself established many records on the running path and won more amateur track-championships than any other individual.” And it was safe, George said: the 100-Up is “incapable of harm when practiced discreetly.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Could it be that simple? That day, I began experimenting on myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;[... two pages later ...]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last fall, at the end of a local 10-mile trail race, I surprised myself by finishing five minutes faster than I had four years ago, when I was in much better shape. I figured the result was a fluke — until it happened again. No special prep, awful travel schedule and yet a personal best in a six-mile race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I don’t get it,” I told Cucuzzella this past June when we went for a run together through the Shepherd University campus in Shepherdstown. “I’m four years older. I’m pretty sure I’m heavier. I’m not doing real workouts, just whatever I feel like each day. The only difference is I’ve been 100-Upping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this last bit got everyone excited and within days, Justin of &lt;a href=&quot;http://birthdayshoes.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Birthday Shoes&lt;/a&gt; fame, knocked up a dedicated site - &lt;a href=&quot;http://hundredup.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HundredUp&lt;/a&gt; - to raise awareness and put out &lt;a href=&quot;http://hundredup.com/the-100-up-challenge/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a challenge&lt;/a&gt; to people to try it themselves for 30 days and report back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, as I&#39;m keen on learning about improving my performance, I read through McDougall&#39;s article, watched the video, and read through the HundredUp site.  McDougall&#39;s demonstration of the exercise in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.nytimes.com/video/2011/11/02/magazine/100000001149415/the-lost-secret-of-running.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video in the NYT&lt;/a&gt; article instantly rang bells, but I couldn&#39;t place why.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was only this weekend that I worked it out... this is a lot like the &quot;tapping&quot; and &quot;change of support&quot; exercises from POSE running, except with more emphasis on high knees than on bringing the foot up under your body.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Compare for yourself.  First, the 100-Up video which shows the minor and major:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/by-rbM101XE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next, the tapping and change of support exercises from POSE (the commentary is in German, but you&#39;re only meant to be looking at the pictures &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;)...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/O8GZatLrgGw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/qhWFZ_Fe27Y?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interesting stuff. Of course there will be some overlap in methods taught - I&#39;m sure Chi Running probably has a similar exercise too - and for all I know, Dr. Romanov could have taken some of his inspiration from W.G. George&#39;s 100-ups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reasoning, I think any exercise that encourages people to land on their mid-foot or forefoot and that strengthens the muscles and tendons around that area is better than nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Bruised Toes</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/bruised-toes\"/>\n   <updated>2011-11-13T16:58:07+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/bruised-toes</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;About two thirds of the way into my long run today I somehow managed to trip over something and severely stub my toes.

I think they&#39;re just a little on the bruised side. Thankfully I was wearing my Merrells.  Who knows that my toes would look like had I not been.  Hopefully this won&#39;t affect my running too much.  I managed to finish my run this morning which entailed about another 7km after the stubbing without any discomfort.  We&#39;ll see how things are tomorrow.  Time to go ice them.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Bruce Fordyce Takes Parkruns to South Africa</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/bruce-fordyce-takes-parkruns-to-south-africa\"/>\n   <updated>2011-10-06T13:34:29+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/bruce-fordyce-takes-parkruns-to-south-africa</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; alt=&quot;Parkrun Logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/parkrun.png&quot; width=&quot;205&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I&#39;ve just received this weeks&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.com/about/news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parkrun newsletter&lt;/a&gt; (dated 6th October 2011) and I&#39;m very chuffed to find this within it:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My reason for returning to South Africa was to spend a few days with an African running hero who has decided to bring parkrun to the masses in his homeland. Many of you were previously introduced to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Fordyce&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bruce Fordyce&lt;/a&gt; last year when he ran Bushy parkrun the day before completing his forth London Marathon. For the unenlightened, Bruce is a running legend throughout the world with many records to his name not least of which is the nine wins at the grueling &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comrades_Marathon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Comrades Ultra Marathon&lt;/a&gt; of which eight wins were consecutive. Bruce has won the London to Brighton ultra marathon three years in a row plus a number of other highly significant events and still holds the world record at 50 miles. He is a previous record holder for 100 mile distance too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I first met Bruce in 1987 when I was part of a 6-man team providing information and support during his 7th Comrades win. Little did I know the circle would be closed when Bruce took part in the Bushy parkrun this year and decided that parkrun was something that South Africa needed. Introducing parkrun to Africa is not without challenges as the majority of the population does not have Internet access and don’t receive email. Nevertheless, it is with excitement and pride that I announce that Bruce is now our Southern Africa parkrun representative and if all goes to plan in the next few weeks we will see the first African parkrun start in Delta Park, Johannesburg on the 12th November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is brilliant news and I can almost guarantee this will be an incredible success.  I would expect this Parkrun will be very busy from day one and I reckon it&#39;ll surpass any UK event in number of runners within a few weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I used to run for the club Bruce runs for, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rac.co.za/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rand Athletic Club&lt;/a&gt;, (I&#39;m assuming he still runs for RAC, I&#39;ve not seen anything to say he doesn&#39;t) which is one of South Africa&#39;s largest running clubs with over 2300 members.  They already have a very popular weekly 5 and 8k time trial on Tuesday evenings and I would expect these Parkruns to be just as popular, especially as Delta Park isn&#39;t far from Old Parktonian Sports Club.   Delta Park is also nicely situated for Randburg&#39;s other large club, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randburgharriers.co.za/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Randburg Harriers&lt;/a&gt;, so if you add their numbers too, this will be huuuge in no time. Of course the Randburg Harriers runners may not be too happy with the Parkruns clashing with their Saturday time trials, but who knows, maybe they&#39;ll ditch the Saturday runs in favour of the Parkruns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll certainly be keeping an eye on the developments of this and may just pop round for a quick spin round Delta Park (I haven&#39;t run in Delta Park since I ran cross-country in high school) when I&#39;m over in December.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">I Nearly Killed a Child</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/i-nearly-killed-a-child\"/>\n   <updated>2011-09-28T10:24:49+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/i-nearly-killed-a-child</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, my barefoot running antics nearly killed a child.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was out running through Caversham and got the usual comments about running without any shoes on. The level of intelligence in today&#39;s youth is truly amazing - &quot;&lt;em&gt;Hey, you&#39;ve got no shoes on&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.  &quot;&lt;em&gt;Really?  I hadn&#39;t noticed. Thanks for pointing it out. I&#39;ll remember to check my feet next time I head out for a run&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. :-|&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on my return to the gym, as I was crossing &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.co/maps/9mekr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reading bridge (George Street)&lt;/a&gt; to head back along the Thames path, I encountered a particularly &quot;intelligent&quot; woman and watched her nearly kill her child because of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those who don&#39;t know, George Street across Reading bridge is a particularly busy road.  It&#39;s one of only two large bridges across the Thames in Reading that is usable by large trucks and a lot of cars going to or coming from Oxfordshire, from and to Reading. This, along with Caversham bridge (the other big bridge) is naturally a very busy road.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s not very easy to cross as there are only three crossings, one on the Reading end of the road and two close to each other on the Caversham end.  To make matters worse, there is a park entrance just on the Caversham side of the bridge, just below the crest as you head into Caversham.  This spot is  particularly popular with pedestrians who can&#39;t be bothered to walk under the bridge to cross the road, and it is here that I nearly killed a child.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I ran up George Street I noticed two women with a pushchair standing on the side of the road by the park entrance waiting for a gap in the traffic so they could cross.  A gap appeared in the traffic coming from Caversham (the direction I was coming from) so the women started to make their move.  The woman pushing the push chair pushed it off the curb and completely into the road.  She remained standing on the pavement. She then noticed me - the expression on her face was priceless - running towards her without any shoes on.  This must have been far too much for her simple mind to cope with as she just stopped dead still with her child in the pushchair in the middle of the road.  She then waited for me to reach her just so she could tell me I wasn&#39;t wearing any shoes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now the thing is, I only run at about 10kph.  Cars cross that bridge at around 50kph (30mph).  Naturally I was overtaken by a car so a car got to her before I did.  Thankfully the driver was paying more attention than the woman was as the driver slowed down and leant on his hooter for a good long loud BEEEEEEEP!!!!  This nearly scared the sh*t out of the woman with her child in the middle of the road as she jumped back but let go of the pushchair leaving the child in the road.  Just as well her friend had the right mind to grab the pushchair and pull it back onto the pavement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now comes the unbelievable part: once the woman recovered she still took the time to tell me I wasn&#39;t wearing any shoes when I did eventually pass her. Unbelievable!!  She was more interested in telling me something I already knew than care for her child.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I know it was &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; fault as the appearance, behaviour and demeanor of this woman led me to believe had something happened, she would have almost certainly blamed me. That&#39;s the mentality of some of the people in this area.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So there you have it, I nearly killed a child by not wearing any shoes. How many other people can say this?&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">1000km So Far This Year</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/1000km-so-far-this-year\"/>\n   <updated>2011-09-26T10:09:44+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/1000km-so-far-this-year</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Somehow I missed this when I added my last training run, but check it out, I&#39;ve tipped over the 1000km mark for my running this year:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/1000km.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;1000km in 2011 already&quot; src=&quot;/assets/1000km.jpg&quot; width=&quot;803&quot; height=&quot;119&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Assuming I put in about 200km a month for the rest of the year (not likely), I could crack the 1000 mile mark this year.

There are a few races left this year I might look to do before Christmas, but nothing I&#39;ve got my heart set on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, it means it&#39;s time to start building up the base for next year&#39;s racing season.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today I discovered maximum aerobic function (MAF) training (&lt;a href=&quot;http://philmaffetone.com/files/Want_Speed_Slow_Down_2007.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; from Phil Maffetone who came up with the idea).  Essentially, you take 180, subtract your age, add or subtract a bit more based on health and experience and then use the range of that number less about 10 bpm as your training range. You then do all your &quot;base&quot; training in that range and see great results.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This all sounds well and good and the long term results sound good, but I&#39;m concerned about this rather generic approach, especially considering if I took 180 and subtracted my age (31) and added 5 (I pretty much meet criteria 4 in the link above), I get a heart rate of 154 BPM.  This is not very high at all, especially considering that I&#39;ve clocked a maximum HR during a race (Woodley 10k in which I set my season best) of 203 this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone had any experience with using this MAF method for their base training?  I&#39;m interested in the positive and negative experiences people may have had.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The other approach I&#39;ve been contemplating is Arthur Lydiard&#39;s run a &quot;million miles a week&quot; approach, but that scares me, unless of course you&#39;ve got some good information on that topic too.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Mo Farah Wins 5000m Final at the 2011 Daegu World Champs</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/mo-farah-wins-5000m-final-at-the-2011-daegu-world-champs\"/>\n   <updated>2011-09-05T11:10:40+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/mo-farah-wins-5000m-final-at-the-2011-daegu-world-champs</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just caught up on the coverage of the men&#39;s 5000m final at the 2011 Daegu World Champs and Mo Farah is on fire.

We&#39;ll have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, I actually know someone who ran in that race: Alistair Cragg.  His dad used to coach us when we both lived back in South Africa. I think he had an OK race.  He started off very well but got left in the dust when the pace picked up quite considerably at about 2600m.  He ended up finishing 14th over-all and got a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/14780934.stm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;whole article for his efforts on the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">30 Day Challenge Completed</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/30-day-challenge-completed\"/>\n   <updated>2011-09-01T17:07:07+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/30-day-challenge-completed</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Well folks, I&#39;m pleased to say I succeeded in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/challenge-run-at-least-3km-everyday-for-30-days&quot;&gt;challenge to run at least 3km every day for 30 days&lt;/a&gt; as my Calendar page from Garmin Connect can attest:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/i-qQwdQ9g/0/XXL/30DayRunningChallenge-XXL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/30DayRunningChallenge-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;30 Days of Running at least 3k a day&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;At least 3k/day for 30 days = 231.18k for the month&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This was a great challenge and one I&#39;m going to come back to, but maybe not quite so rigidly or with so much gusto at the start of the month.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As part of doing my 30-day challenge, I decided I would NOT give myself a training programme to follow.  I would just run and listen to my body, with the exception that I would do a long run on the weekend.  If I felt good and felt I could go fast, I did.  If I felt like plodding, I did.  This worked really well and I ended up only wearing my Garmin to record my route and distance as evidence of my progress and only checked it at the end of each run.  It&#39;s quite refreshing just running again without any trying to run to clock or beeping pacer.  I think I&#39;m going to start doing this more often.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now forcing myself to run everyday has taught me a few very important things. Running every day is fantastic, when you&#39;re up for, but you MUST listen to your body and take a break when it says you need one. If you don&#39;t and you run, you won&#39;t enjoy it and may start to resent it. You&#39;re also likely to incur aches and pains and niggles or even a full on injury if you don&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think I may have gone out a bit too far a few times in the first 3 and a bit weeks and by Friday the 26, I really wasn&#39;t up for running and starting to feel a little over-trained.  This is when I&#39;d normally take a day or two off, but didn&#39;t as I was aiming to complete this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I&#39;ve had to force myself to take a break after 30 days.  I find myself feeling a little over-trained with my right hip flexor a little tender after runs.  I wouldn&#39;t call it an injury, just an annoying niggle that wasn&#39;t there before. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll give myself the best part of a week off and start a similar challenge again, but this time without any rigid goals.  Who knows, maybe 3 long hard weeks is my limit and maybe the 4th needs to be considerably lower in mileage than I did.  Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I&#39;m very impressed with is the monthly total: 231.18k of running.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Amazing Finish in the Men’s 10,000m at the 2011 Daegu World Champs</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/-amazing-finish-in-the-men-s-10000m-at-the-2011-daegu-world-champs\"/>\n   <updated>2011-08-28T19:40:32+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/-amazing-finish-in-the-men-s-10000m-at-the-2011-daegu-world-champs</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I watched this live this morning on the BBC and must say I was on the edge of my seat.  This was probably the most gripping 10,000m race I&#39;ve watched and oh so close for Mo Farah.

Over the same distance, Farah takes 31.5 steps in about 9.3 seconds, for a cadence of 203.23 steps/min. What this suggests is that Jeilan was able to ramp up his turnover during the final stretch to catch up to and pass Mo Farah just before the finish line, whereas Farah’s turnover remained consistent. The one additional step gained by Jeilan by ramping his turnover up was enough for the win!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My money is on Mo Farah for the Olympic Gold in 2012.

First, Adidas appears to be making a much bigger statement about the potential impact of minimalist shoes on their market than any of the other major brands have dared do - Nike Frees are NOT minimalist or &quot;like barefoot&quot;.  I don&#39;t care what Nike say.  Secondly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://birthdayshoes.com/vibram-fivefingers-sues-fila-skele-toes-for-patent-infringement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vibrams are currently suing Fila for patent infringement&lt;/a&gt;.  Has Adidas licensed these patents from Vibram or are they going in guns blazing and hoping to dig themselves out when the pooh when it hits the fan?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve already got 3 pairs of Vibram Five Fingers (VFF) and really enjoy running in them.  I also quite like the look of these new Adidas Adipures and if the planned price is anything to go by, they&#39;ll be offering a good alternative to VFFs at a comparable price.  The pictures and the Gizmodo review however concern me a bit: they seem to indicate a fair bit of cushioning so I&#39;d like to try these on before coughing up my cash.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Long Runs are Back and They&#39;re Good</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/long-runs-are-back-and-theyre-good\"/>\n   <updated>2011-08-07T13:22:56+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/long-runs-are-back-and-theyre-good</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;My new &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/challenge-run-at-least-3km-everyday-for-30-days&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;30 day challenge&lt;/a&gt; has already helped my running... it&#39;s given me the motivation to actually starting doing long runs on the weekends again.  Today I headed out for my first weekend long run in a very very long time and I really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t push things too hard and just aimed for 15km or 75mins, whichever came first, over as much offroad terrain as I could (I wore the Merrell Trail Gloves).  In the end it was the 15km mark that came first, but only by about 2 mins.  I kept things at a pretty consistent pace (around 4:47/km) and it was only the last 4 up hill kilometers that I really slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was really enjoyable and great to be back out on the roads early on a Sunday morning when no one is around, though that said I was quite surprised at the number of families already taking a stroll around the local lakes and ponds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll definitely be looking forward to next weekend&#39;s long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and this long run completes what has ended up being a bumper week in the mileage front: 58km in total this week which is pretty high considering I also had a 10k race on Wednesday.

This was my first and probably last running of this race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The 10k race is a very very flat two lap race around the top of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.co.uk/?ll=51.481917,-0.548587&amp;spn=0.024615,0.052314&amp;t=h&amp;z=15&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Queen Mother Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; on trail/gravel path and grass with a small section of tar as you pass the clubhouse to start your second lap.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things started well for this run.  I&#39;d had a good day at work and was in a good mood, full of energy and I felt I had a new personal best (since returning) in me that night.  I headed off to the race with plenty of time, but after a few judgement errors in my attempts to avoid traffic I ended up cutting things a bit fine and arrived at the Datchet Water Sailing club with only 10 minutes to spare.  Thankfully I was already changed so with my adrenaline levels high, I grabbed my cash and dashed up to the club house, nearly puked as I entered the clubhouse which was really hot and reeked of old chip fat (I&#39;m not a fan of the smell of old grease), paid my entrance fee and headed outside for my hurried warm up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At 19:30 promptly the 10k runners were sent on their way.  Earlier that evening there had been a mighty downpour which left the grass and path very wet with a lot of puddles.  It was also quite humid. I started well and soon got into a comfortable pace around about 3:55/km running on the grass alongside the path.  I found the gravel path a bit more slippery than the grass.  Anyway, I was chugging along nicely and then something happened... I got bored. I lost all motivation to actually push for a fast time and started to wonder if it would have been wiser to run just the 5k.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think the thing that got to me was this is really a bit of a boring race.  It&#39;s two identical flat laps with very little in the way of scenery other than the view of Windsor Castle which you could only see from one corner and the undersides of aeroplanes coming and going from Heathrow.  There wasn&#39;t much in the way of spectators either with sheep being the primary spectators around the course and a few people at the 5k/finish line.  There also weren&#39;t that many runners in the 10k so company was quite scarce.   I was so bored that I worked out that the people who would fill the top 20 places were determined within the first 2km (I was one of them).  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite my boredom and loss of motivation, I still finished in 16th place (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepatchrunning.com/images/stories/QMR-WebResults10kRace3-2011.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;out of 141&lt;/a&gt;) in a time of 40:43.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Other than that, a well organised and friendly race, though the smell of grease and then sewerage as you passed the club house wasn&#39;t very nice at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t let my comments put you off this race, this race is probably perfect for those who like nice flat lapped courses.  I don&#39;t. I&#39;ve never been a big fan of lapped races and this run confirmed why I don&#39;t particularly like them. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll run this race again.  &lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Now on Google+</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/now-on-google\"/>\n   <updated>2011-07-26T11:24:41+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/now-on-google</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;For all those jumping on the Google+ bandwagon, I am now one of them and &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/+&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I am now on Google+&lt;/a&gt;.

Looks like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/health/nutrition/21best.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research is on the way&lt;/a&gt; to confirm that this doesn&#39;t really make much difference toward preventing injury.  I think it should still be followed when starting barefoot running: not for injury prevention, but to acclimatise your feet to the new sensations.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Race Report: Stoke Row 10k - 2011</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-stoke-row-10k-2011\"/>\n   <updated>2011-06-22T17:40:42+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-stoke-row-10k-2011</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;On Sunday 22 May 2011, I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;http://stokerow10k.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stoke Row 10k&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.  It&#39;s a relatively close race to home, but the thing that sold it for me was free music festival in the pub gardens afterwards. I thought this would be a great opportunity for my wife to have something to do whilst I run around the &#39;burbs and it would also make the run a bit of a &quot;grand day out&quot;, which it proved to be, but we&#39;ll get onto the day&#39;s entertainment in a moment.  First the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First, the race description...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10k route will start and finish at The Cherry Tree Inn, Stoke Row, taking you through some beautiful undulating Oxfordshire Countryside. Starting at 10.30 am, you will be chip timed, have water stops, plenty of clear route signage and marshalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is pertinent as &quot;undulating&quot; is probably a little tame, but &quot;hilly&quot; is a bit too severe.  This is quite a tough run as the elevation graph from my Garmin shows...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Profile of Stoke Row 10k&quot; src=&quot;/assets/stokerow10k-profile.jpg&quot; width=&quot;595&quot; height=&quot;292&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;The greenline is the elevation - I&#39;ve scaled the image a bit to give you an idea of how it felt to me.&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there&#39;s quite a bit of climbing involved.  It is also mostly offroad which the race description doesn&#39;t mention.  It would have been good to know this in advance as I would have liked to have tackled it in my Merrells.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;The race starts on the grass outside the pub and funnels everyone across the finish line (probably so the computer can register the chip starting the race).  At the moment it&#39;s still a small race so there&#39;s plenty of space for the runners, but I think this race may increase in popularity which means they&#39;ll probably have to rethink the funnel start - possibly extend the funneling a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The grassy start is only about 50m before you break out onto the road and start heading downhill, and quite quickly too.  Before you know it, you&#39;re diverted off the road onto a wooded trail and you drop about 35m in altitude to reach the lowest point in the race just after 1km.  And then you start climbing... for about 3.5km.  There&#39;s a little table top as you cross a farmers field and then a slight dip, but nothing worth getting too excited about as you&#39;re soon climbing again. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, things ease off a bit from about 5km, where the one and only water station is.  After you&#39;ve freshened up, you&#39;ve got a good little downhill to get your legs going again and then it&#39;s moderately flat with a slight downhill feel for the next 2 and a bit kilometers. This is mostly along a shaded twin trail path alongside farmland with some lovely views.  This twin trail can be a bit challenging as you&#39;ll definitely be thinking &quot;I&#39;m sure the other path is smoother than this one?&quot;.  You&#39;ll switch and then start thinking the same thing about the path you&#39;ve just come from.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After this, you wind you way along some tarred road for a bit before dipping back into the cover of the woods for a nice fast short downhill stint.  This is a very cunning ploy as it gets you all excited before making you climb the steepest and toughest of all the hills in the race.  And to make matters worse, this steep hill is all off road on a very uneven path.  Once you pop out at the top of the hill, you need to muster all your energy to keep you going up the final tarred incline to the finish.  Unfortunately, it was at the point of popping out of the woods that we could have done with a marshal as your natural tendency was to turn right, which several people did, including the first lady.  I nearly did, but noticed another marshal further up the hill to the left so headed that way, and called back the guy who&#39;d turned right ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Being a good sport I also let him pass me again back to the finish as he would have finished ahead of me had he not gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The finish is then back on the grass outside the pub where you started.  Once crossing the line, you&#39;re handed a goody back, which this year included a coffee mug and a homemade flapjack which was very tasty, though no where near big enough for my tastes &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Several people have commented that the course was too long.  My Garmin recorded the distance at 10.4km and whilst I agree it may have been slightly over 10k, I don&#39;t think it was too much.  I can&#39;t trust my Garmin too much given the amount of time spent running under quite dense wood.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.racetimingsystems.com/public/results.aspx?raceid=1534&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official results&lt;/a&gt; for the race put me in 15th place out of 272 finishers with a race and chip time of 43:43.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there wasn&#39;t much in the way of entertainment during the race, so my wife and her parents had to keep themselves busy eating bacon sarnies and drinking tea and coffee, but from midday things started to get more entertaining.  The pub set up a limited bar outside and ran the usual bar inside.  Unfortunately, they&#39;re limited by the single till inside so the two queues for the main pub bar were out the door all day. Normal pub food was on offer from the main bar and burgers and other BBQ stuff from the outside bar.  We went prepared with a picnic so only needed drinks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As we were there from the race, we managed to nab ourselves one of the double deck chairs (what a brilliant idea) that had been set out, laid down our picnic blanket in front of it and made ourselves comfortable for the entertainment, which included, to quote the website...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carol Decker, The Lynne Butler Band, The Joint is Jumping, Kith and Kin, Bleak Angel, The International Ukulele Club of Sonning Common, The Cotton Dons, The McRobbies, Better Than Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t see everyone as we only stayed for the most famous person, Carol Decker, who happens to be the wife of the pub landlord, who came on late in the afternoon.  Once she&#39;d done her bit, we headed off home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all a very enjoyable, scenic and challenging race with great post-race entertainment making this a good day out.  The only downside for the whole day was the cold wind that kept punctuating the afternoon whilst we were enjoying the music and the long queues to get drinks from the inside bar.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">2011 Mid-Year Update</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2011-mid-year-update\"/>\n   <updated>2011-06-16T17:15:52+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2011-mid-year-update</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Well, we find ourselves in the middle of 2011, not quite slap bang in the middle, but near enough for me to provide a mid-year update.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So far my training programme has suited me well, though I will be making a slight change. Since the beginning of December last year, I&#39;ve been working on the following schedule:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Monday: run - usually a hard session&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tuesday: swim - usually about 2.5km&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wednesday: run - varies between easy and hard, depending how I feel&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thursday: full body weights session&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Friday: run - usually a longish tempo run&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Saturday and Sunday: either race or rest&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All training has been almost exclusively barefoot and when it hasn&#39;t been, as with all racing, it has been in either my Vibram Fivefinger Bikilas (road) or Merrell Trail Gloves (off-road).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now we&#39;re in race season, this format has changed slightly, only in as much as weights sessions are dropped before weekend races and after Wednesday races.  For the rest of the year, I&#39;m going to switch the swim and the weights sessions around, unless I&#39;m racing on the Wednesday in which case I won&#39;t do a weights session.  I&#39;m also going to start adding in at least one more run, probably on the weekend, to try and up my mileage a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Mileage&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Talking of mileage (or should I call it &quot;kilometerage&quot; as I do everything in metric?), last night saw me click over the 500km mark in training and racing this year.  I&#39;ve been quite good at recording my training and racing, but realised I&#39;ve not been tracking my warmups and cooldowns for races, each of which is easily 2 - 3km each, whilst I have been for training.  I&#39;m going start recording these now too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, I should tip over the 1000km mark by the end of the year.  Nothing in comparison to what a marathon runner may clock up, but certainly a long way for someone who runs mostly barefoot, is concentrating on speed and who only clocked up 668km last year. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Racing&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now with all this training and some pretty good mileage, how has the actual racing been going?  Well, actually very well.  Here are my results so far this year:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table id=&quot;bests-table&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Race&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Target Time&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Actual Time&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2011-04-23&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Reading parkrun 5k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:19:30&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:19:33&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2011-05-02&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Shinfield 10k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:43:00&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:40:42&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2011-05-15&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Woodley 10k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:42:00&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:39:42&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2011-05-22&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Stoke Row 10k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:45:00&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:43:44&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2011-06-01&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Yateley 10k Series - Race 1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:43:00&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:39:51&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2011-06-11&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Reading parkrun 5k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:19:00&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:19:13&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2011-06-15&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Forest Five (miles)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:32:00&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:32:03&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nI didn&#39;t expect to get back below 40 mins for 10k this season but so far I&#39;ve managed it twice and once so far on the Yateley 10k which is considered a bit of a harder run.  If I&#39;d thought I was capable and aiming for it, I think I could have dipped below 40 mins for my first 10k too.  That will definitely be on the cards for next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got a couple more interesting and fast races scheduled for the rest of the year so hopefully I can get a few more sub-40 10k&#39;s and hopefully that sub-19 5k.  I&#39;d love a sub-18 5k this year, but I think that&#39;s pushing it a bit.  I had originally planned a sub-18 5k this year, but now I&#39;m in full swing, I&#39;ve come to realise this is a bit of an unrealistic goal for this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Rest&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So as you can see, so far so good.   However if I want to keep this up I need to rest, and it&#39;s time for a rest.  I haven&#39;t had a rest since the week starting 14 March when my wife and I had a lovely week long break in the Lake District so I&#39;m taking the next week off to give my body a chance to recover.  The intention is to do absolutely no exercise at all, bar cycling to and from work.  If I get the urge, I may do some exercise which is not running or commuting, so either a swim, indoor rowing or possibly a weights session, just no running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and Tuesday this week saw me tick off another goal I&#39;ve had on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/2011-running-goals-and-aspirations&quot;&gt;2011 list&lt;/a&gt;, but haven&#39;t actively been gunning for: I&#39;ve dipped below 80kg in weight for the first time in years.  I&#39;m not a svelte 78.8kg. Down over 20kg since 29 Jan 2010 and down 5kg since January this year.  And best of all, I haven&#39;t been on any specific diet.  Exercise alone and my usual healthy diet has done it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, the first half of this year has gone well on the running front and hopefully the second half will be just as good, if not better.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Old Training and Racing Records</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/old-training-racing-records\"/>\n   <updated>2011-05-30T12:56:21+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/old-training-racing-records</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I commented on Twitter (which published to Facebook) that I&#39;d be gunning for a new 10k &quot;personal best since returning&quot; (PBSR) to running in the Shinfield 10k.  My cousin &quot;Liked&quot; this and then followed up the next day asking how it went as this excerpt from Facebook shows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;FBConversation.jpg&quot; src=&quot;/assets/FBConversation.jpg&quot; width=&quot;462&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My cousin has a fair point there, I shouldn&#39;t really be resetting my PBs, however my response did get me thinking... maybe I should dig out those old floppies and see if I can extract the data from the old application, Gotorun, to see what I could find.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Well, thankfully I DO still have an old laptop with a floppy drive.  It wasn&#39;t long before I had all the data off the floppies and stored in image files for manipulation later.  The next day I set to hacking my way through the database files to see if I could work out what database was used and then export the contents to CSV.  It didn&#39;t take long and thanks to the Linux and open source community, I had my data exported from the proprietary database to CSV and imported into an OpenOffice spreadsheet.  A little more tinkering and I&#39;d extracted all my races into tabs by distance so I could easily see how I&#39;d done all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With this data at hand I made quite a few interesting observations:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I seemed to have suffered a major data loss at some point as I know I&#39;m missing entries and a lot of the early entries had the comment &quot;Re-entry after data loss&quot; for their &quot;Notes&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It was around about March 1998 that I started getting quite good at documenting my training and racing.  Prior to that I didn&#39;t record much, though I suspect this may be due to not having discovered Gotorun at that stage or, as I mentioned above, I&#39;d had some sort of data loss.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I WALKED a half marathon with my girlfriend at the time and &quot;&lt;em&gt;Vowed never to walk a half marathon again.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; This made me smile.  I still stick to this rule.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I was quite a quick boy with the following PBs:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5km&lt;/strong&gt;: 18:35 on 26 Jan &#39;99 - I seem to only have one 5k on record and it&#39;s one of my last runs in SA.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8km&lt;/strong&gt;: 29:09 (X-Country) on 2 May &#39;98 and 30:49 (Road) on 17 Nov &#39;98&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10km&lt;/strong&gt;: 36:52 on 31 Dec &#39;98 - Yes, I raced a nite race on new year&#39;s eve.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15km&lt;/strong&gt;: 59:29 on 10 Jan &#39;99&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21.1km&lt;/strong&gt;: 1:26:31 on 20 Apr &#39;98&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32km&lt;/strong&gt;: 2:36:56 on 23 Nov &#39;97 - I know for a fact I ran this race in &#39;98 too, but this entry seems to be missing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;42.2km&lt;/strong&gt;: 4:11:13 on 22 Feb &#39;98 - My one and only marathon, used to qualify for the Two Ocean&#39;s Ultra marathon below. Terrible time due to inexperience and getting caught out by a 2-lap course.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;56km&lt;/strong&gt;: 4:48:24 on 11 Apr &#39;98&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I did record a quicker 10k time of 35:37 on 30 Jun &#39;98 but commented &quot;Short Course&quot; in my logs so I&#39;m discarding that quicker time.  I also recorded a quicker 8k time of 20:24 which I also determined to be a very short course.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All but my marathon times are really good and certainly provide some big challenges for me if I&#39;m going to get back to that level before I get too old.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those that are curious, you can take a look at the spreadsheet via &lt;a href=&quot;https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_GB&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;key=0AuOMs6ftXZbgdGllNng3cnpqcWhweHNMQUxYd21KY1E&amp;output=html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Docs here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Race Report: Woodley 10k 2011</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-woodley-10k-2011\"/>\n   <updated>2011-05-28T17:35:35+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-woodley-10k-2011</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;On Sunday 15 May 2011 I ran what I think I should start to call my local 10k race - the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.woodley10k.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Woodley 10k&lt;/a&gt;. As with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-shinfield-10k-race-2011&quot;&gt;Shinfield 10k&lt;/a&gt; race, this is also a fast and relatively flat race and I thought I may just be able to get the sub-40min 10k I just missed at Shinfield.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following a request from a colleague, this and hopefully my future &quot;first time&quot; race reports, will be a bit more in depth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Given Woodley is so close to home, and the fact that parking is limited to pretty much whatever Woodley town centre has, my wife and I cycled to the race.  Bike racks are very limited too, but nothing a long chain and a firm fence post or tree couldn&#39;t solve.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Woodley 10k starts and finishes at the town end of Memorial Recreation Ground on Headley Road in Woodley.  When we got there the kiddies&#39; 3k race was still underway and in it&#39;s final stages and quite a large crowd of runners and supporters building up around the start/finish area. For those concerned about these sort of things, there were plenty loos on offer: about 8 port-a-loos as well as those in the buildings at the recreation ground, and a fitness instructor gave a little aerobics type warm up routine just before the race started.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;The start was effectively a very wide mass congregation behind a line drawn on the grass.  There&#39;s nothing to really restrict you behind the start line, but once you cross it, you&#39;re funneled down from a width of about a football pitch to the width of a 2 lane road in about 200m thanks to orange mesh fencing on either side.  This is definitely long enough and I didn&#39;t notice any severe bunching, though I did find myself up near the front so I have no idea what it was like further back in the field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once off the field, it&#39;s a bit of a sharp turn into the rec ground drive, across two speed bumps and then out onto the road.  I can imagine this initial bit being a little tough with a large crowd.  Once on the road, it&#39;s quite flat for about the first 2.5km as you make your way through the quiet neighbourhood roads and then you get your first climb as you head up towards Bath Road.  Nothing major, but noticeable enough to drop my pace below 4:00/km for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once you reach Bath Road, you run a short section on the pavement and then turn back in towards Earley to the first water station.  It&#39;s then pretty flat and fast for the next 2km until you reach Wokingham road where you will find yourself at the highest point in the race looking as a great big long downhill towards the Showcase roundabout. According to my Garmin, we dropped about 25m in altitude over about 2.2km.  This is a great downhill to the lowest point in the race with the only thing slowing you down being the water station as you pass Station Road at about the 6km mark. It&#39;s then a slow and continual climb back up the hill back towards Woodley with another water station at about the 8km mark.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This hill is quite a toughie and took quite a chunk out of my time.  Thankfully I&#39;d built up quite a &quot;cushion&quot; in the preceding kilometres so by the time I turned back into the recreation ground road, I was still on course for a sub-40 min 10k.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The race then finishes back on the field you started on, but a little to the side of the starting straight with a little climb to give you a final burn on your legs as you sprint to the cross the line. Well, it burnt my legs as I had someone breathing down my neck for most of the long hill.  He passed me just as we entered the rec grounds, but I dug in deep and sprinted away from him on the grass to finish the race in a new &quot;PBSR&quot; (personal best since return) of 39:42.  Yes folks, I&#39;d just dipped below 40 mins for the first time in well over 12 years and I felt great.  Knackered, but absolutely delighted with myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the race is chip timed, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsystems.co.uk/ss/results/Woodley%2010K/585&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official results&lt;/a&gt; were available pretty quickly and were printed and stuck to the window of one of the buildings as they became available.  Just before leaving, I popped over to confirm my time and position. I couldn&#39;t believe it, I was on the first page of results in 23rd place (out of 596 runners).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a well earned reward, my wife and I then cycled down to our favourite pub, The Wheelright Arms, and have a big Sunday roast and a couple of beers for lunch.  All in all this was a great race and a great day out.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">VivoBarefoot Achilles - Performance Running Sandal</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vivobarefoot-achilles-performance-running-sandal\"/>\n   <updated>2011-05-25T13:34:00+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vivobarefoot-achilles-performance-running-sandal</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just received this &lt;a href=&quot;http://communicatoremail.com/IN/cLXRXbND9K4zwL29ebtWFE5-v7W6xFYMB7n7LPgPuzO/WebView.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;newletter&lt;/a&gt; from Terra Plana in which they announced these rather strange looking &quot;fully moulded performance sandals&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://communicatoremail.com/IN/cLXRXbND9K4zwL29ebtWFE5-v7W6xFYMB7n7LPgPuzO/WebView.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/VIVOBAREFOOT_The_Achilles_UK_May_2011_r5_c1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Achilles Running Sandal.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m intrigued.

The weather was warm, the skies clear and I was in the mood for some running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt; I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readingroadrunners.org/shinfield.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reading Runner&#39;s Shinfield 10k&lt;/a&gt;, my first 10k for the year.  As this is known to be a fast flat course, I also thought it would be a good chance to set myself a new &quot;since returning&quot; personal best to get the running season off to a good start.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to this race, my PB was 44:26 run on the Yateley 10k course.  I&#39;ve been training a lot more carefully and consistently this year so thought a PB was definitely on the cards and aimed for what I thought was a good time of sub-43 mins.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started the race as I usually do - too fast - but for some reason it felt right and the pace - about 3:56 - 4:00/km - was very comfortable.  Given I&#39;m concentrating on 5k this year, I thought maybe it was because I&#39;ve been consistently running as faster paces in training that this faster than planned pace felt so comfortable so I stuck with it in the belief I&#39;d probably slow down dramatically at 5k or maybe 6.  Well, I did slow down on the 5th km, but not because I was tired from going too fast, but because the 5th km had the water station in it. I&#39;ve still not mastered drinking water from a cup whilst running and really miss the Miltons tasting water baggies we used to get in South Africa.  The 6th, end of the 8th and all of the 9th kilometers were slow due to a strong head wind and I finished off the 10th nice a quick.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the 8th and 9th kilometers were hard due to the wind and I like to push the last kilometer, I didn&#39;t actually check my watch for about 2.5 to 3km so had no idea how close I was to my goal of a sub-43 so imagine my surprise when I rounded the corner onto the finish straight to see the clock saying 40:30.  Huh!!! 40!!  I was shocked.  Without even trying to I&#39;d nearly run a sub-40 10k at the very beginning of the season. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the end I finished in a time of 40:42 and was as chuffed to bits. I still can&#39;t believe I managed such a great time. I definitely believe I have a sub-40 min 10k in me this season but I wasn&#39;t expecting one until at least next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As this was a race and I&#39;m now &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/2011-running-season-off-to-a-good-start&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;racing in minimalist shoes&lt;/a&gt;, I raced in my Vibram Five Finger Bikilas.  What a good idea.  Several large sections of the course had very questionable tar, some very course concrete and a long offroad section as we crossed a field between 8 and 9km.  Had I been barefoot, I think my goal of sub-43 may have been a little over optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all a brilliant start to the season.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readingroadrunners.org/Shinfield/Shinfield10kFinalResults2011.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official results&lt;/a&gt; are now out and I came 59th out of 696 runners.  Not bad at all. I&#39;ll definitely be doing this one again next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">My Roving Garmin Forerunner 405CX</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/my-roving-garmin-forerunner-405cx\"/>\n   <updated>2011-05-03T17:37:03+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/my-roving-garmin-forerunner-405cx</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to deliberately drain the battery in my Garmin Forerunner 405CX to get it to correctly reflect it&#39;s battery usage (I&#39;m sure this is a firmware bug, but Garmin don&#39;t seem to be doing anything about it), last night I set the backlight timeout to &quot;never&quot;, enabled the backlight, enabled the GPS, started the timer and place the watch on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today I imported the data (cos I&#39;m curious) and check out where my watch went when I wasn&#39;t watching...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;stationaryGPS.jpg&quot; src=&quot;/assets/stationaryGPS.jpg&quot; width=&quot;586&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It managed to rack up 1.7km which is pretty impressive considering the window was closed too &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">I am Now an e-Club Runner</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/i-am-now-an-e-club-runner\"/>\n   <updated>2011-05-01T16:59:31+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/i-am-now-an-e-club-runner</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;My running is coming along nicely now and I&#39;m regularly putting in the miles.  Last year I only did 3 official races, other than the 3 free 5k Parkruns.  This year I plan on doing quite a few more, so I&#39;ve decided to join a running club.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I don&#39;t need the services of a full running club.  I have my own training programmes and goals and don&#39;t have the desire to join a proper running club and join in the club runs etc just yet.  Most of this stems from the fact most clubs I&#39;ve seen in the UK have a tendency to concentrate on the two extremes of running: marathon or track.  They do a little in between like cross-country and shorter distance road running, but don&#39;t seem to put the same emphasis on these as they do for marathons or track.  As I&#39;m doing neither extreme at the moment so I decided to join an online-only running club, or what I like to call an &quot;e-club&quot;.  I&#39;ve joined the...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fetch Everyone logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/fetch-everyone.gif&quot; width=&quot;119&quot; height=&quot;56&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/ferc.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fetch Everyone Running Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the princely sum of £16 (£15 membership + £1 PayPal admin fee) plus another £20.99 for the vest, I am now a fully fledged (well almost, I&#39;m waiting for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uka.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UKA&lt;/a&gt; to &quot;unlock&quot; my URN) club runner in the UK and I have the vest to go with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;So why join a club if you&#39;re not going to take advantage of the club runs etc?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; you may be thinking.  Well it&#39;s all about economics my dear Watson.  Most UKA affiliated races in the UK charge on average £2 more for non-affiliated runners than they do for affiliated runnings.  I believe this has to do with insurance. As an affiliated runner, you will be considered in county/country championship races (if you&#39;re that good).  There could be other benefits with being affiliated but I&#39;m not sure what they are. If anyone else knows, feel free to chime in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that struck me as a bit odd with the UK&#39;s licensing system, as becoming a UKA affiliated runner is essentially licensing, is how little is actually involved and how there is nothing to identify you to others that you&#39;re affiliated.  I&#39;m used to the South African system in which you register with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.athletics.org.za/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Athletics South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and in return you receive a fabric race number to sew onto your running vest.  This number is valid for a year and clearly indicates you&#39;re a licensed runner.  This has the added benefit that you don&#39;t have to pin paper numbers onto your vest at each run (you need to do this in the UK) and thus you cut down on landfill, safety pins and paper cuts.  In South Africa, as a licensed runner the only thing you get when you register for a race which doesn&#39;t provide it&#39;s own numbers like the Comrades or Two Ocean&#39;s marathons, is a little sticker in a small plastic bank bag which you pin to your shorts/shirt and then hand in at the end of the race.  If the race uses timing chips, you don&#39;t even need them, but they&#39;re often used as a manual backup.  Maybe we&#39;ll see something like this in the UK in the future, though I&#39;m doubtful as there seems to be a fair amount of animosity towards UKA and the whole registering/affiliation thing. I&#39;m not entirely sure why but I suspect it may have something to do with a change in the way the affiliation process several years ago. If someone has more details, I&#39;m intrigued to know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m now an affiliated runner and have several races lined up for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">2011 Running Season Off to a Good Start</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2011-running-season-off-to-a-good-start\"/>\n   <updated>2011-04-29T09:54:16+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2011-running-season-off-to-a-good-start</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;In January I drew up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/2011-running-goals-and-aspirations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;few goals for the year&lt;/a&gt; regarding the 5K distance, namely sub 19-min around about 2 April and then a sub 18-min 5K by the end of the year.  Well, I think I was a little over-ambitious with these goals.  The 2 April deadline came and went without a run.  Problems on the home front meant there was no way I was going to be running that weekend, so I delayed my attempt.  In training I soon realised I wasn&#39;t like to get sub 19-min this early in the season either, so I settled for around about 19:30 for the start of the season and we&#39;ll see how I get on from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, last Saturday I kicked off my 2011 season in fine form.  It was a gloriously sunny day and I headed down the road for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/default&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reading Parkrun&lt;/a&gt;, my first for the year.  The weather was good and the turnout was incredible.  At 9am we were sent on our way and I soon fell into the groove and had a very enjoyable run, in my Merrell Trail Gloves.  I&#39;d actually forgotten I&#39;d set myself a mini-goal of 19:30, but ended up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/results/weeklyresults?runSeqNumber=81&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;finishing 10th over all in a new PB of 19:33&lt;/a&gt; anyway.  Not bad if I say so myself.  I definitely need to work on my speed, overall cardio levels and race pacing but I&#39;m still way fitter and better than I was this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things are going to be a little different this year on the racing front too: I&#39;m going to be racing in shoes, well actually in Vibram Five Finger Bikilas on the road and Merrell Trail Gloves offroad.  I&#39;ve come to this decision for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;English councils and the Highways Agency are currently in a rather frugal phase when it comes to repairing and maintaining roads. Potholes aren&#39;t repaired until someone loses their car in it and the current surfacing policy seems to be spray some sticky stuff onto the tar that&#39;s already there, throw some black stones at it and see what sticks. As a result, the roads are effectively big long stony paths with a nice build up of loose stones towards the curbs.  This is a nightmare to run on barefoot and quashes any hopes of a good time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I plan on spending a lot more time running offroad.  I find running offroad very enjoyable and way more relaxing than running on the road. I&#39;ve also got my eye on several races that are either entirely offroad or have sections which are offroad and these are generally not very conducive to barefoot running.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m gunning for some good times this year.  I&#39;ve got a good year&#39;s worth of training and running under my belt now, so I think I can start pushing things a bit and aiming for the times I used to run.  I don&#39;t expect to be anywhere near my all-time personal bests, but I am hoping for some good times, and I don&#39;t want these attempts ruined by encountering one of the above issues.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I will however continue to do most of my training barefoot.  Offroad training runs and recovery runs will likely involve shoes, but that&#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Monday sees my first 10K of the season on the rather flat (apparently) Shinfield 10k coarse.  As it&#39;s apparently a flat one and I&#39;ll be running in the Bikilias, I&#39;m hoping for a good time to start the season off with. We&#39;ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Motivational Email</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/motivational-email\"/>\n   <updated>2011-04-17T22:59:10+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/motivational-email</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I enjoy blogging.  I like to share my views and opinions and knowledge, but more importantly, I like to inspire, especially when it comes to running.  The other day I received this great email from &lt;a href=&quot;http://warhippo.co.uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt; which I thought others considering barefoot or minimalist running may find interesting and motivational...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Colin&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just found your site (barefootrunner.co.uk) whilst searching for flat running shoes and have enjoyed what I&#39;ve read.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Much like you I started running many moons ago, suffered shin splints and knee problems so gave up running, got into weights and then tried running every few years (only to find the injuries kept coming back).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A year or so ago, my wife started running, which gave me a push to try again - only this time I was armed with all the powers of the internet : ) I learnt about persistence running and decided to change how I ran and I&#39;ve not looked back since - I now run mid / forefoot without any heel strike. I only run twice a week (both times off road, one 3 miler in the hills and one 4 miler on sand dunes). I wear a pair of hi-tecs with hardly any heel and virtually no cushioning at all (it&#39;s taken me several months to get to the point where I can run without the usual padding but it&#39;s so much been worth it).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve taken it slowly as I herniated a disc in my spine 3 years ago which has taught me a lot about going steady and building on solid foundations. At the time, all the medical professionals told me that I had to give up weights but after a dose of hard graft I&#39;m still training with weights and my back is getting stronger all the time. I&#39;m certain that running has helped me get through this nasty injury and strangely, going through the injury has helped to teach me to be more adaptive. Consequently I am back running when before the injury I would have simply given up on it and said that &quot;I&#39;m not built for running&quot; - how many times have you heard that?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I love barefoot hiking so barefoot running is something I&#39;m working towards (or at the very least barefoot running technique combined with barefoot running shoes).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, keep up the good work!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers - Jon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And then in a separate email in response to the one I sent in response to the one above...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like your goal setting page. I believe that setting (and attaining) progressively more difficult goals is very much the road to success - but I never forget to reward myself upon attaining them (achieving a goal is not always enough of a reward in itself). My running goal is far less specific than yours, since I&#39;m not interested in competing (not that I currently could - LOL), all I want to achieve this year running-wise is to be able to run in the hills for an hour without it being too difficult. It&#39;s a very broad goal but with my injury I&#39;ve found that broader goals are far less restrictive - but that&#39;s just me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I didn&#39;t mention was that in the last year or so I&#39;ve gone from just shy of 14 stone to 12 stone and the only thing I&#39;ve changed about my routine is swapping one of my 45 minute weights sessions for a 30 minute running session each week (and missing second breakfast which was a tin of rice pudding). Have I lost muscle? Probably some but since I continue to get stronger (I can deadlift 200 kilos, squat 140 kilos, bench 110 kilos and do bodyweight chins + 60 kilos) I don&#39;t really care - I&#39;m done with looking big for the sake of looking big - functionality over form is far more my style now and running is an essential part of that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#39;m waffling, I&#39;ll let you know how I get on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for sharing your experiences and for letting me post them here.

Thankfully, I had a bumper week this week on the mileage front, so I can take things a bit easier next week.  A series of long gentle runs should be sufficient to allow my body to recover after last week&#39;s efforts, provided the heat doesn&#39;t kill me first.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My diet goes to pot.  Restaurant food just isn&#39;t the same as home cooked food and often contains way more calories and &quot;bad stuff&quot;.  I also love the opportunity to try new food when in foreign countries (especially when I&#39;m expensing my meals &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; ) and I find I turn to the plethora of junk foods and sweets we don&#39;t get in the UK just to see what they&#39;re like.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not this time.  This time I&#39;m making a concerted effort to keep my diet in check.  No fast food and where possible no chips, potatoes, rice or bread.  I&#39;ve chosen these four ingredients to concentrate on as they are the fillers almost every restaurant uses to fill their plates.  This inevitably leads to over eating and by the end of the week, the last thing I want to eat is chips, potatoes, rice or bread.  Instead I&#39;m asking for substitutes: extra veggies, beans, salad or nothing and I&#39;ll add a side salad. Oh yes, and NO fizzy pop.  The US has gargantuan sized soft drinks and in this heat I can easily see myself gulping loads of fizzy pop, especially Mountain Dew and Coke, if I&#39;m not careful.  Instead I&#39;m having beer (they&#39;re smaller than in the UK) and water only.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If I&#39;m diligent with this, I think I may actually lose weight this week, eat better and feel better for it.  I&#39;m also hoping it will help with the jetlag and accordingly I&#39;ve set it as a mini-goal for myself.  If I don&#39;t lose any weight, so what, but if I do I suspect I&#39;ll feel better in the long run than I normally do when cross-timezone travelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update - 19 April 2011:&lt;/strong&gt; I can confirm I did indeed lose weight whilst travelling on business.  Weighed myself today and clocked in at 80.7, down from 81.7.  I think this is the first time I&#39;ve lost weight whilst travelling, especially to the US.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Log On To Help Prevent Injuries</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/log-on-to-help-prevent-injuries\"/>\n   <updated>2011-02-24T16:37:44+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/log-on-to-help-prevent-injuries</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Are you a runner - barefoot isn&#39;t essential?

Some of it I will have to take with a pinch of salt, but after today&#39;s little experiment, I&#39;ll certainly be trying out a few of the ideas in this book.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As has become habit as part of my current training programme, I swim on Tuesdays - I&#39;m paying for a gym membership with a pool, so I&#39;m going to blooming well use it.  Prior to today, my sessions comprised of 80 lengths of 25 meters broken up into sets of 10 lengths alternating crawl and breaststroke.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The alternation was required because my crawl has never been my strong point and I was finding completing 10 lengths pretty tiring and hard.  I&#39;m well trained in breaststroke as it was my primary stroke when I competed at school so it&#39;s a breeze in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;One of the chapters in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0091939526?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0091939526&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The 4-Hour Body&lt;/a&gt; is &quot;&lt;em&gt;How I Learnt to Swim Effortlessly in 10 Days&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.  It&#39;s not a very long chapter - in fact Tim Ferris, the author actually published the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/08/13/total-immersion-how-i-learned-to-swim-effortlessly-in-10-days-and-you-can-too/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;entire chapter on his blog years ago&lt;/a&gt; - but it provides enough information to get you heading in the right direction: that of learning how to swim crawl using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Immersion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Total Immersion&lt;/a&gt; method. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing crawl is my weakness, I read the chapter and followed up by investigating on the Internet.  One of the links Tim provides in the book is to this video...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/rJpFVvho0o4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a word: Wow!!! I was amazed at how graceful this guy was swimming with such little effort and at quite a pace too.  By comparison, I must look like a flailing idiot who&#39;s only just keeping himself from drowning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after re-reading the chapter and watching all the videos I could find on the topic, I hit the pool this morning for my first session of Total Immersion crawl.  Well, to say I&#39;m impressed is an understatement.  I&#39;m amazed. Gob-smacked and downright impressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I took my time to make sure I performed everything as I had seen in the various videos and in the book and soon got into the swing of things.  Before I knew it, I was on my 20th lap, still doing crawl, and I didn&#39;t want to stop.  What was a relatively little change has made a dramatic improvement and I easily completed 100 lengths (2.5km) in 49 minutes WITHOUT having to stop (except to get water out of my goggles and to hit the button on my watch) and without having to do any breaststroke.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My times were also dramatically improved. To give you an idea of how much, here are my 10 lap splits from a recent swim (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/training-log-view.php?id=6103196&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;25 Jan 2011&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/training-log-view.php?id=6154793&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table style=&quot;border:0;margin:0 auto;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;BEFORE&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;AFTER&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot;&gt;Crawl: 5:56 (leaky goggles)&lt;br /&gt;\nBreast: 5:34&lt;br /&gt;\nCrawl: 5:37&lt;br /&gt;\nBreast: 5:29&lt;br /&gt;\nCrawl: 5:42&lt;br /&gt;\nBreast: 5:33&lt;br /&gt;\nCrawl: 5:48&lt;br /&gt;\nBreast: 5:34&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;4:53&lt;br /&gt;\n4:55&lt;br /&gt;\n4:59&lt;br /&gt;\n4:52&lt;br /&gt;\n5:00 (leaky goggles)&lt;br /&gt;\n5:00 (leaky goggles)&lt;br /&gt;\n4:53&lt;br /&gt;\n4:56&lt;br /&gt;\n4:59&lt;br /&gt;\n4:57&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, that&#39;s well over 30 seconds improvement per 250m in 2 weeks and I&#39;m pretty sure that improvement has nothing to do with improved fitness.  I think this is all down to an improved stroke.  I had actually only intended on doing 2km, but as I got there so quickly and easily, I threw in 20 more lengths and I think I could have carried on for a fair bit more had I the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My stroke is nowhere near as smooth as in the video, and I kick a bit more than he does, but it&#39;s certainly much better than it was. I&#39;m very impressed with this and am looking forward to next week&#39;s swim already.  All I need to do now is try and hone things a bit, improve my pace and learn an efficient tumble turn and I&#39;ll be zooming up and down the pool like a demon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still deciding on what I&#39;ll do next from this book, but I&#39;ll certainly keep you posted on what I do do and how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Happy 1st Barefoot Anniversary To ME</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/happy-1st-barefoot-anniversary-to-me\"/>\n   <updated>2011-02-04T12:56:05+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/happy-1st-barefoot-anniversary-to-me</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Oooops, I&#39;ve just realised I missed my own 1st barefoot anniversary. So...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:40px;line-height:1em;&quot;&gt;Happy 1st Barefoot Anniversary to ME&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, 1 February was the big day.  A whole year since I made the big decision to run completely barefoot as much as possible.  I&#39;ve not run all my runs and races barefoot in that time due to sensitivity, rough terrain, extreme temperatures, shoe reviews or because I really didn&#39;t feel like it, but well over 95% of my running has been completely barefoot since then.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a great year and certainly a massive learning experience.  The muscles in my feet are stronger than they&#39;ve ever been.  The skin on the bottom of my feet is becoming more and more like tough leather. My form is good and I know my running is the best it&#39;s been since I moved over to the UK.  The last year hasn&#39;t all been a bed of roses, I did suffer what was probably a &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/tofp-probably-stress-fracture&quot;&gt;stress fracture in my 3rd metatarsal&lt;/a&gt; back in July, which in hindsight was probably due to the problems I&#39;ve had with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/finally-sorting-my-back-out&quot;&gt;right sacroiliac joint&lt;/a&gt;.  Since visiting the physio and consequently paying a lot more attention to my core, I&#39;ve had no problems with my feet and my right hip and lower back are considerably better. I think my running may have also improved as a result of the extra attention I&#39;ve been paying to my core.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I said back in January, my goals for this year are to continue running barefoot as much as possible and to concentrate on the 5km distance.  I&#39;ll still be doing 10k races, but mainly for fun and training.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just as well my wife has suggested a visit to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thewheelwrightsarms.co.uk/home.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;favourite pub&lt;/a&gt; (they always have on at least 6 real ales ;-p) for a few bevvies tonight.  Think I may have to dedicate one as a celebratory drink. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers everybody.  I think this next year is going to be a good one.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">The Wheatsheaf Pub Doesn&#39;t Like Bare Feet in Their Garden</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/wheatsheaf-doesnt-like-bare-feet-in-garden\"/>\n   <updated>2011-01-23T18:51:17+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/wheatsheaf-doesnt-like-bare-feet-in-garden</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Sign spotted at the foot of the steps into the Wheatsheaf Pub last summer when my wife and I went for a walk around Virginia Water (I&#39;ve only just found it after trawling through all my photos I&#39;ve taken but not done anything with)...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/1156589096_WtDSR-L.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Footwear must be worn in the garden&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I can understand the need for tops at all times (some people don&#39;t like looking at boobies) and shoes in the pub, but what&#39;s so wrong with toasting my piggies in the garden?

I&#39;ve done this in the past, but that&#39;s changing this year as I&#39;ve actually thought about it and put the plan into action already.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;I don&#39;t have many running goals for this year, but the ones I do have, I&#39;ve broken up into two categories: hard goals and soft goals.  Hard goals are those I&#39;m actively training for.  The ones I really want to achieve.  The soft goals are the &quot;nice to haves&quot; and in theory if I achieve the hard goals, I&#39;m likely to hit the soft goals without much more effort. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Hard Goals&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Run a sub-19 minute 5km, barefoot, by the end of the first week of April&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Run a sub-18 minute 5km, barefoot, by the end of the year&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;NOT to race any distance higher than 10 miles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These are pretty ambitious goals, but certainly not unrealistic.  My current PB (ignoring my PBs from years ago) for &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/parkrun-two-and-a-pb-too&quot;&gt;5k is 19:41&lt;/a&gt; and that was clocked last year in what I&#39;d say was a far from optimal fitness level.  Knocking 41 seconds off in 3 months shouldn&#39;t be too hard if I train sensibly - it&#39;s about quality, not quantity.  Once I&#39;ve got below 19 minutes, 8 months to knock off another minute, whilst tough, should be possible.  Of course, if I fly through the 18 minute mark, I will re-assess my goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Soft Goals&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Run a sub-40 minute 10km by the end of the year&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lose at least 5kg in body fat (My current mass is 84kg)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This year is all about the 5km distance for me.  Most runners I know dismiss the 5km as just fun-run stuff, and whilst I agree it is commonly associated with fun runs, it is also a distance that is all about speed, without being track-based.  Speed is not something you&#39;ll have forever and is probably one of the hardest things in running to get back once you&#39;ve lost it.  It&#39;s also the one thing every runner wishes they had more of.  Concentrating on the 5k distance will hone my speed which will then transfer into much quicker 10k (and longer) races later on.  Concentrating on 5k will also allow me to improve my form at speed and allow me to &quot;master&quot; the distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not entirely neglecting longer distances, I&#39;m just not concentrating on them and will be allowing my 5k training to carry me through and improve my 10k times.  I&#39;m not running any further than 10 miles / 16km as I think this takes me too far away from concentrating on the 5km distance.  I also don&#39;t want to be bitten by the long-and-slow bug just yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;So How Am I Going To Do It?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m taking a full-body &quot;quality not quantity&quot; approach with emphasis on running and core strength.  My training program is broken down as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday:&lt;/strong&gt; Run + core exercises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday:&lt;/strong&gt; Alternate non-impact cardio - primarily swimming, but rowing and cycling may be thrown in too&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday:&lt;/strong&gt; Run + core exercises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday:&lt;/strong&gt; Full body weights session + core exercises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday:&lt;/strong&gt; Run + core exercises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday &amp; Sunday:&lt;/strong&gt; Rest, though I may throw in a recovery run here and there if I feel the need or I&#39;m in the mood&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All runs will have a purpose.  No idle running for the sake of clocking up miles.  I&#39;ve deliberately NOT specified what running training I&#39;ll do on each day as this WILL change as my programme changes and as my mood changes and how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Where possible/plausible/desirable, all runs will be barefoot.  The only times I anticipate I won&#39;t run barefoot is for long recovery runs - &lt;em&gt;recovery&lt;/em&gt; means all of me must recover, including the soles of my feet if they&#39;re feeling a little tender - off-road runs, run in sub-zero temperatures and races on unknown routes or obviously rough terrain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been following this programme more or less to the word for about 5 weeks in total now: 2 weeks in December before the Crimbo hols and 3 weeks in January (I&#39;m part way through the 3rd week now) and it&#39;s definitely well within my capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If I stick to it, am sensible and listen to my body, I think I should be able to attain all of my hard goals.  I&#39;ll certainly let you all know if I do or don&#39;t.  Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll get to see the south-side of a 17 minute 5k before the year&#39;s out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also added the hard goals to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/a&gt; page so I can tick them off and will be constantly reminded of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Barefoot Cufflinks</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-cufflinks\"/>\n   <updated>2011-01-19T18:37:31+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-cufflinks</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Look what my wonderful wife got me for Christmas...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/1156577556_e5PVd-S.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Barefoot Cufflinks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think these are terrific.

Well how about taking them on a barefoot holiday.  Yes, a barefoot holiday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just discovered there are these really cool &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barfusspark.info/en/park.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;barefoot parks&lt;/a&gt; all over Europe (predominantly in German and Austria) that are open to the public and offer you the opportunity to go for barefoot walks. These parks actually encouraged you to take off your shoes and get one with nature (you&#39;ll have to go elsewhere if you want to really get one with nature &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; ) and feel the earth below your feet, feel the cold water between your toes and the pebbles under your feet as you walk through streams and rivers.  Some even offer playground areas specially designed for being bare foot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What a great idea, and what a great way to get the whole family involved in your new found passion for going barefoot.  Who knows, maybe after one of these holidays your wife or one of your kids will want to join you on one of your barefoot runs, barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">2010 in Summary</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2010-in-summary\"/>\n   <updated>2010-12-31T23:59:55+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2010-in-summary</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Diing doong diing dooong... diing doong diing dooong.. yes folks, Big Ben is starting to chime out 2010 and chime in 2011 so it&#39;s time for my annual summary of the year gone by.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This year started off with a bang with &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/todays-run&quot;&gt;9 inches of snow&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.co.uk/introducing-lara-nieve-seymour&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;birth of my daughter&lt;/a&gt;.  Sadly, this delight was soon turned to immense sadness as my little girl was born with a heart defect and &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/back-online&quot;&gt;sadly didn&#39;t make it through surgery&lt;/a&gt;.  It was during the tough time of waiting for my daughter to grow big enough for surgery that I switched to predominantly running completely barefoot and I haven&#39;t looked back.  I still go out for the occasional run in shoes of sorts, but most of my runs are now barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Publicity&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2010 saw quite a huge rise in popularity and interest in barefoot running with &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/book-born-to-run-by-christopher-mcdougall&quot;&gt;Born to Run&lt;/a&gt; becoming quite a motivator for a lot of people along with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/my-thoughts-on-the-lieberman-paper&quot;&gt;Lieberman Paper&lt;/a&gt; - this last post even saw me getting a comment from the king of barefooters - &lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barefoot Ken Bob&lt;/a&gt;.  This interest and enthusiasm was further amplified by the introduction of the first pair of barefoot-like shoes specifically designed for running when Terra Plana released the Evo.  I was lucky enough to be provided a pair for &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/review-terra-plana-vivobarefoot-evo-running-shoes&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;.  This year also saw other manufacturers release their own &quot;barefoot&quot; running shoes, though I&#39;ve not had the privilege to try any of these yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We also saw several prominent barefoot runners release books, including Michael Sandler&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/getting-michael-sandlers-barefoot-running-book-in-the-uk&quot;&gt;Barefoot Running&lt;/a&gt; book (note to self: I still need to write my review on this book) and Jason Robillard&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/book-review-the-barefoot-running-book-by-jason-robillard&quot;&gt;The Barefoot Running Book&lt;/a&gt;.  There have been other books, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re really much more than jumping on the bandwagon type of books.  Next year however will see what I&#39;m hoping will be the &quot;Bible&quot; of barefoot running: Barefoot Ted&#39;s book - &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-ken-bob-s-running-barefoot-book&quot;&gt;The Complete Book of Barefoot Running&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This year I was also quoted in two printed articles. First was an &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/run-like-your-ancestors&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; for the University of the West of England&#39;s student paper The Western Eye and the second saw Runner&#39;s World quote me in a pretty one-sided (against) &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/naked-truth-about-barefoot-running-runners-world-uk-april-2010&quot;&gt;article on barefoot running&lt;/a&gt;. It was nice to see my name in print and good to see the likes of Runner&#39;s World start to take note.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Racing&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When things started to warm up in the spring, my running really started to pick up too.  I ran three of the Reading Parkruns completely barefoot.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/reading-parkrun-barefoot&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; was a taster to see how I would get on.  Once bitten by the racing bug, I ran my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/parkrun-two-and-a-pb-too&quot;&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; a week later and smashed my previous time and dipped under 20 mins to finish with a time of 19:41.  My &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-reading-parkrun-three&quot;&gt;third&lt;/a&gt; run was several weeks later and also a sub-20 finish time, though not quite as fast as my PB.  Between the 2nd and 3rd Parkruns I also ran my first road race in the UK, &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/yateley-10k-series-race-1-completed-barefoot&quot;&gt;the Yateley 10k&lt;/a&gt;, and I ran this completely barefoot too in a time of 46:05.  A month later I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-yateley-10k-series-2010-race-2&quot;&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; in the series in a new PB of 44:43. Between the two 10k races I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-the-forest-five-2010&quot;&gt;Forest Five&lt;/a&gt; but as it was offroad and my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/racing-offroad-research-it-first&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; deemed it unsuitable for barefoot, I ran this in my Vibrams.  This was a lovely race and one I&#39;ll definitely be doing again next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Injuries&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, all did NOT go well on the running front this year.  During the second Yateley 10K I managed to really &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/tofp-probably-stress-fracture&quot;&gt;hurt my left foot&lt;/a&gt; with what I suspect may have been a stress fracture.  This took me out of action for 6 weeks.  Not long after returning to running after this forced rest I finally sought advice on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/finally-sorting-my-back-out&quot;&gt;recurring pain I was getting in my lower back and right sacroiliac joint&lt;/a&gt;.  My first visit to the physio quickly identified the problem and also the most probably cause for my foot injury: I had a hypo-mobile right sacroiliac joint caused by excessive use of my abs, back muscles and hamstrings for stability rather than using my glutes and core muscles. This immobility is likely to have caused over compensation elsewhere which in turn is likely to have led to odd foot placement or twisting when running.  Thankfully, after a lot of core exercises designed to strengthen and engage my core muscles, I am now pain free and I think my running has improved too. The only thing is I need to keep doing these exercises regularly to ensure my core remains strong and I remain painfree, but as these aren&#39;t too long or intensive this can easily be done as part of my warm-ups and cool-downs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My training went very well, especially when I start of following a programme, sort of.  I didn&#39;t rigidly follow the programmes in the &quot;Brain Training for Runners&quot; book, but used it as a guide for my own running.  Next year I plan to do the same thing, but more actively and schedule in some target races so I can see how I&#39;m progressing.  I&#39;ve also now joined the local David Lloyd gym and even though I &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-in-david-lloyd-gyms&quot;&gt;can&#39;t go barefoot in the gym&lt;/a&gt;, I plan on using the gym facilities to the full extent to cross-train to improve my running.  This year also saw me becoming a bit more hard-core with some &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-cold-winter-run&quot;&gt;barefoot runs in the cold&lt;/a&gt;. Snow and Christmas has limited the number of these, but not significantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A quick look at my training log totals for the year is also quite telling (figures are in Km):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Training Log Totals - 2010&quot; src=&quot;/assets/TrainingLogTotals-2010.jpg&quot; width=&quot;530&quot; height=&quot;80&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The high mileage in April and May along with my hip problems are likely to have led to the injury in July and the subsequent decrease in mileage for the subsequent months as I tried to ensure I didn&#39;t do too much too soon.  October was an exception as I went on holiday and there was no running on this holiday and December, well Christmas and snow is all I need to say here. Not a bad total either. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all, 2010 has been quite a busy year for me.  Lets hope 2011 is a better year with more running, more racing, more happiness and less injuries.  Time to draw up my list of goals for 2011 too.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Foot Stickers</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/foot-stickers\"/>\n   <updated>2010-12-30T13:36:49+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/foot-stickers</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Now this is an interesting concept: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/12/foot-stickers-the-most-minimal-sneakers-around/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;foot stickers&lt;/a&gt;...  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Foot Stickers&quot; src=&quot;/assets/FootStickers.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why wear a whole shoe when all you need is a little protection on the bottom of your feet? A great idea, though I think it may not be particularly practical to implement, especially for outdoor use.

As I would no longer be going anywhere near Camberley, I cancelled my old gym membership at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foundationfitness.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Foundation Fitness&lt;/a&gt; (free plug: this is a great, friendly and very affordable small gym in Sandhurst that I would have continued being a member of if it were practical) and waited to see what the Oracle offering is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oracle&#39;s offering is a heavily discounted corporate membership with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; gym across the road.  Normally David Lloyd is way too expensive for my liking, but with the corporate discount, it&#39;s no more expensive than what I used to pay for Foundation Fitness, so I signed up from 1 December.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Between 1 December and 9 December, I went to the gym 6 times and on all 6 occasions I was barefoot for pretty much most of the time I was in the gym.  I performed all my warm ups for running and swimming barefoot, I performed by cool downs barefoot and even performed my weights session barefoot (my squats are much better barefoot) without a single person approaching me or even commenting.  Yes, I got some strange looks, but that&#39;s expected when people aren&#39;t used to something new.  Anyway, that was until the 9th.  During my weights session that day, I was approached by one of the instructors and told that her manager had told her to come tell me to put shoes on as it&#39;s &quot;policy&quot;.  I questioned this policy but she couldn&#39;t tell me anything about this policy other than her manager told her.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to cause too much of a scene, not wanting to delay my training and clear in the knowledge she wasn&#39;t going to be able to help me further - obviously a policy the general staff aren&#39;t too aware of - I obliged and grabbed my Vibrams from the changerooms and continued my workout, but I wasn&#39;t going to let this one lie.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;On returning to the office I trawled through the Ts &amp; Cs and documents I&#39;d been given and I couldn&#39;t find any rule or policy preventing me from going barefoot so I thought I&#39;d email the branch&#39;s general manager to find out more.  I couldn&#39;t find a direct email address, but I did find a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/home/clubcontact/faqs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contact form&lt;/a&gt; in which I posted the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been a member now for just over a week and have attended the gym on 6 separate occasions, each time barefoot. I am a full time barefoot runner and attempt to do as much of my exercises barefoot so as to continue enhancing and improving my barefoot running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today I was approached for the first time by one of the instructors, [ removed to protect the person&#39;s identity &lt;!-- Bethan Thompson --&gt; ], and was told her manager had told her to come tell me to put shoes on as it&#39;s policy. Unfortunately, she could not tell me where this is documented or why such a policy exists.  She did however confirm that Vibram Five Finger &quot;shoes&quot; were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So with this in mind, I&#39;ve got a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1.  Where is it documented that all members should wear shoes in the gym?  I may have missed something in the documentation I was provided on joining.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2.  What is the substantiation for this policy?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3.  If this policy exists, what is the procedure to get it reconsidered?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4.  I&#39;m happy to abide by this policy if it exists, but what about situations where I go out for a run barefoot and then enter the main gym to perform my cool down stretches prior to going for a shower?  Am I expected to put on my Vibram Five Fingers for the 5 - 10 mins I&#39;ll be cooling down?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More and more research is proving the benefits of performing exercises and running barefoot, and in fact I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of your own classes encourage  being barefoot. It would be a shame for an organisation that prides itself in being knowledgeable and up-to-date on fitness topic to be left enforcing outdated and unsubstantiated policies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not trying to make waves or be belligerent, I&#39;m just keen to found out more about this policy. Given David Lloyd actively advertise they&#39;re open to changes in policy based on member feedback, I&#39;m eager to see such a policy documented, substantiated, changed or revoked.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&lt;br /&gt;\nColin\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not long after submitting my form, I received a response confirming receipt of my email and that it would be forwarded to the sports and general managers for review on Monday as they were both on annual leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Much to my surprise I received a call from the sports manager &lt;!-- Gareth --&gt; at about 15:30 on Friday 10 December and we discussed this a bit.  Apparently the policy about wearing shoes falls under the following very vague and general term in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/static/downloads/DL-Members-Hndbk.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Member&#39;s Handbook&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part B - Terms and conditions of use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n1. General health and safety&lt;br /&gt;\n[ ... ]&lt;br /&gt;\ng) While you are at the club, you are expected to behave and dress appropriately, respectfully and politely at all times. We can prevent you entering the club, you to leave or cancel your membership if we think that your behaviour or appearance is not suitable\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s worth pointing out the printed version isn&#39;t quite so appallingly written:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part B - Terms and conditions of use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n1. General health and safety&lt;br /&gt;\n[ ... ]&lt;br /&gt;\ng) While you are at the club, you are expected to behave appropriately, respectfully and politely, and dress appropriately (for example by not wearing your swimsuit in the club room), at all times. We can prevent you from entering the club, or ask you to leave if we think that your behaviour or appearance is not suitable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the sports manager then went on to admit it was a very vague term and also tried to explain that they don&#39;t use pins, but if I accidentally stood on one, they&#39;d be responsible.  I pointed out that Vibrams don&#39;t offer much protection from this &quot;accident&quot; to which he responded &quot;but they&#39;re still a form of footwear&quot;.  He admitted that dropping a weight on my foot wouldn&#39;t really be different whether I was wearing a shoe or not.   I then asked what about things like pilates and yoga classes and the Power Plate device in which barefoot is often encouraged.  The sport manager then pointed out that they don&#39;t encourage barefoot on the Power Plate (I acknowledged I&#39;ve not seen it at Reading, but I do know other sources suggesting it) and &quot;classes take place in studios&quot;, which seemed like a bit of a roundabout way of saying &quot;they&#39;re exempt because no one can see them&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The sports manager then seemed to become in a bit of a hurry and I definitely got the feeling that he was trying to speed up the conversation to finish off quickly.  He confirmed that the general manager would be in on Monday and that he&#39;d discuss it with him in more detail then.  He confirmed that they don&#39;t like to get in the way of members&#39; beliefs and passions and that as I clearly am quite dedicated and passionate about being barefoot, one of the things he would discuss with the general manager would be the idea of me signing a disclaimer absolving David Lloyd of any responsibility for any injury I may incur due to not wearing shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I said I&#39;d be more than happy to sign such a disclaimer and I looked forward to his or the general manager&#39;s call on Monday, but if signing a disclaimer was not an option, I&#39;d be expecting an answer to my fourth question regarding warming up and cooling down before and after my runs etc which I currently do barefoot.  The sport manager hurriedly said they&#39;ll cover this all on Monday too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Monday I went to the gym as normal and obeyed the rules and wore my Vibrams whilst in the gym.  I think I may have been spotted by the general manager who probably thought &quot;&lt;em&gt;Oh yes, I needed to respond to that email from that guy who doesn&#39;t wear shoes&lt;/em&gt;&quot; as on my return from the gym I had the following email in my inbox:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subject: \tRE: General Enquiry - from davidlloyd.co.uk&lt;br /&gt;\nDate: \tMon, 13 Dec 2010 12:43:58 +0000&lt;br /&gt;\nFrom: \tMatthew Bridle&lt;br /&gt;\nTo: \tColin Seymour&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dear Colin,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your email regarding barefoot running in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I fully understand your position to barefoot running in the gym and you&lt;br /&gt;\nare obviously very passionate about this discipline.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The main reason we ask all members to where appropriate footwear is&lt;br /&gt;\npurely for hygiene reasons. As I’m sure you are aware the feet can carry&lt;br /&gt;\nmany fungal infections and are more susceptible to abrasions or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;\nWhilst I am not for one minute suggesting that you have this is the case&lt;br /&gt;\nfor you, I hope you understand I have to keep the rules consistent for&lt;br /&gt;\nall 3,500 club members.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It does state in the terms and conditions that you must dress&lt;br /&gt;\nappropriately and this is then expanded in the gym notices to say that&lt;br /&gt;\nfootwear must be worn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I’m sure you can appreciate we are a large company and the rules for&lt;br /&gt;\nall clubs have to be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kind Regards&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Matthew Bridle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, it&#39;s nice I got a response though it&#39;s clear he didn&#39;t actually read my email properly. I was also very disappointed, though not surprised, that his response was one of the two fob-off responses I predicted I would get.  As is common with any query about policies, people who: don&#39;t know, don&#39;t want to know, or couldn&#39;t give a monkeys will always respond with an all-encompassing fob-off excuse - in this case &quot;hygiene&quot; - just ask your council why something is so &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .  The other response I was expecting was &quot;health and safety&quot;, both of which are questionable in the case of being barefoot in a gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My full query wasn&#39;t answered either, so I responded:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subject: Re: General Enquiry - from davidlloyd.co.uk&lt;br /&gt;\nDate: Mon, 13 Dec 2010 14:23:32 +0000&lt;br /&gt;\nFrom: Colin Seymour&lt;br /&gt;\nTo: Matthew Bridle&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hi Matthew&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your response.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&#39;t actually questioning running barefoot in the gym, but merely utilising the gym barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your response, though I&#39;m disappointed the response is the very predictable &quot;for hygiene reasons&quot;. It had to be this or the equally predicable &quot;for health and safety reasons&quot;, both of which are questionable and neither consistently enforced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I understand the need for an attempt at consistency though; thanks for answering this part of my query anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My question regarding moving between the front door/change rooms and the warmup/cooldown/stretching area hasn&#39;t been answered.  Must I wear shoes for this short transition and in this area?  I&#39;m particularly concerned&lt;br /&gt;\nabout IN this area as this area is where people train core strength and balance, both of which benefit significantly from being barefoot.  I note this area doesn&#39;t enforce a &quot;clean shoes&quot; policy (like the shower/pool area) so who knows what kind of stuff is being trampled in on people&#39;s trainers and then transferred to their clothes, hands and then onto the gym equipment to be picked up by others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If so, would your front desk staff be happy to look after my shoes whilst I go out for a run each time?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&lt;br /&gt;\nColin&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;PS The online version of the Members&#39; Handbook and the printed copy&lt;br /&gt;\ndon&#39;t match with the online version including a few typos too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I just wanted some clarification on this final point as this is when I&#39;m most likely to be barefoot in the gym and the most appropriate place to be barefoot.  I knew what the response would be, but I had to ask just in case I was wrong, after all this is a company that apparently prides itself in it&#39;s highly trained and educated instructors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The response...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From: Matthew Bridle&lt;br /&gt;\nTo: Colin Seymour&lt;br /&gt;\nSent: Monday, 13 December, 2010 3:33:35 PM GMT +00:00 GMT Britain, Ireland, Portugal&lt;br /&gt;\nSubject: RE: General Enquiry - from davidlloyd.co.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hi Colin,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your response. It is regrettable that you feel the response is predictable. Unfortunately these are the reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You would need to wear footwear to warm up /down. The reception team would happily hold on to your footwear for you whilst you run outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Regards&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Matthew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... but nice to know his receptionists are happy to hold onto my Vibrams whilst I go out for a run.  I wonder if this will change when my Vibrams start getting their own &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/vibram-stink&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;personality&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So as you can see, I&#39;ve been given the classic fob-off response, which really doesn&#39;t surprise me. Given people&#39;s ignorance about the benefits of barefoot, I had to ask. The whole talk of being interested in their member&#39;s views etc is bollocks. They&#39;re here to make money and expect everyone to just shut up and abide by the rules, even if they are very vague, inconsistently applied and not even explicitly documented.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So to summarise...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can you go barefoot in David Lloyd gyms?&lt;/em&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt; you can not go barefoot in David Lloyd gyms, though this will of course be contradicted by the gym themselves when it comes to things like pilates and yoga, because &quot;hygiene&quot; is selective &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why can&#39;t I go barefoot, even in the warmup/cooldown/stretching area?&lt;/em&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, from what I can pick up from the responses of the two managers - they don&#39;t think it looks nice (hence it&#39;s part of the &quot;dress code&quot; rule). Neither do huge fat obese arses in lycra or ancient knobbly knees in shorts, but they&#39;re certainly not going to enforce a dress code here.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I guess in order for this statement on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/home/memberslounge/faqs/complaint-escalation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Complaint Escalation&lt;/a&gt; page (you need to log in to the members&#39; lounge to view this)...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;David Lloyd FeedBack&quot; src=&quot;/assets/DLFeedBack.jpg&quot; width=&quot;490&quot; height=&quot;75&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... to have any sort of meaning I&#39;d have to raise a formal complaint and escalation.  I certainly don&#39;t think this is worth being that petty about, but I think I will have a hunt around for the suggestion box so I can make a suggestion about their dress code policy. Come to think of it, if you&#39;re a member of a David Lloyd and wish to spend more time barefoot whilst working out, please let me know and I may just put up a suggestion request we can all use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re a member of the David Lloyd team reading this, why not raise the suggestion in your next team meeting. Barefoot is good for you.  It makes you stronger and fitter and healthier and the air-time you feet get actually reduces the numbers of bad bacteria and fungus on your feet. The benefits out-weigh the risks. Whilst you&#39;re at it why not ask for a team barefoot training session with Lee Saxby so you can all enhance your skills and understanding of going barefoot or join me for one of my barefoot runs - you will be expected to be barefoot too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and I think I may be on a VIP list (or is it a hit list?) at the gym now as ever since this email correspondence all the instructors who previously didn&#39;t say a word to me and barely acknowledged my existence are all suddenly saying hello, asking how my run was and even popping up out of nowhere where ever I am only to very quickly disappear - me thinks they&#39;re checking up on me. Maybe I&#39;m being paranoid and they&#39;re only being polite now they know I&#39;m around quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">First Cold Winter Barefoot Run</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-cold-winter-run\"/>\n   <updated>2010-12-08T16:04:40+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-cold-winter-run</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Today I ventured out for my very first &quot;very cold barefoot run&quot;.  It&#39;s been a bit late coming as last week saw large parts of the UK covered in snow, and if your area wasn&#39;t covered in snow, it was freeeeeeeezing.  My area was a bit of both - we had a light dusting of snow on two days and then sub-zero temperatures for the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been doing a fair bit of reading on cold weather barefoot running and I&#39;ve drawn a line in the sand (or should that be snow) as to when I will and will not head out for a run barefoot.  That line is 0°C.  This is technically freezing point or water at sea-level and if the air is this cold, there&#39;s a very good chance the ground and water on it will be too - probably colder once you add the salt and grit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On Monday I went out in Vibrams as I had scheduled a fast tempo run along the Thames which would take in quite a long section of pavement that was quite heavily gritted.  It was also bordering 0°C so I didn&#39;t want to risk it.  Today it was definitely warmer, so I decided I&#39;d brave the cold and I&#39;m glad I did.  It wasn&#39;t anywhere near as bad as I thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/?p=7180&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Owen McCall&#39;s very good tips&lt;/a&gt;, I&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;over dressed&lt;/strong&gt;: tights, long sleeve t-shirt, close fitting windbreaker, beanie and gloves&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;warmed up inside&lt;/strong&gt;: dynamic warm ups from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0451222326?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0451222326&quot;&gt;Brain Training for Runners&lt;/a&gt; with some kettlebell swings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... and then headed out a little on the sweaty side.  Normally I&#39;d strip off at this point but I held back and stayed wrapped up for my entire run.  My body and feet soon cooled down a bit in the 1 mile to the field in which I did my 6x600m intervals at 3k pace.  The cool down wasn&#39;t dramatic and I soon found my feet warmed up again too.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The coldest part of the run was running on grassy sections no one else had passed over that day.  The grass was still a little dewy and cold, but thankfully not frozen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bar the very strange looks I got from people I passed, my first very cold barefoot run turned out to be a great success and provided the temperature is above 0°C on a given day and I&#39;m not running through heavily gritted areas, I&#39;ll continue to do my runs barefoot this winter.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Barefoot Ken Bob’s Running Barefoot Book</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-ken-bob-s-running-barefoot-book\"/>\n   <updated>2010-12-01T15:15:14+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-ken-bob-s-running-barefoot-book</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Time to fire up your browsers and head over to Amazon (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Book-Barefoot-Running-Scientifically/dp/1592334652/barefootrunner-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Book-Barefoot-Running-Scientifically/dp/1592334652/barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;) and get pre-ordering.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ken Bob Saxton&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; running barefoot book...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Complete Book of Barefoot Running: Learn the Scientifically Proven Technique for Improving Your Stride and Reducing Injuries&quot; src=&quot;/assets/BarefootRunning-KenBob.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Available for pre-order on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Book-Barefoot-Running-Scientifically/dp/1592334652/barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Book-Barefoot-Running-Scientifically/dp/1592334652/barefootrunner-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Complete Book of Barefoot Running: Learn the Scientifically Proven Technique for Improving Your Stride and Reducing Injuries&lt;/em&gt; (a bit of a mouthful) is now available for pre-order and &lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/?p=7214&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it looks like it&#39;ll be out&lt;/a&gt; in time for next year&#39;s Boston Marathon (18 April 2011).

After all, Ken Bob is probably the most experienced barefoot runner out there and experience counts for a lot.  His &lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; is a continual source of information for many runners, including me, so I&#39;ve got high hopes of this book becoming my font of knowledge when I can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to access the internet to look something up.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Coolboard is Cool for Core</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/coolboard-is-cool-for-core\"/>\n   <updated>2010-11-24T12:51:07+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/coolboard-is-cool-for-core</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;For quite some time now, a colleague at work has had this overly large skateboard propped up against his desk.  I&#39;ve never questioned it and never seen him actually using it and always thought it was some gimmicky toy somehow related to TopGear as it has &quot;CoolBoard&quot; written on it - I&#39;m a techie by trade so it&#39;s not uncommon to encounter strange toys and gadgets in the office.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the other day we were discussing our ailments and the core strengthening exercises prescribed by my physio to help with my hip and that&#39;s when he explained his fancy skateboard to me.  It&#39;s not a skateboard.  It&#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coolboard.co.uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CoolBoard&lt;/a&gt; - essentially a skateboard shaped plank of wood which you then stand on whilst balancing on a 5-inch ball - which, to quote the website, is &quot;&lt;em&gt;the most effective and engaging trainer for balance, core strength and stability, stabilising muscles and proprioception&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;CoolBoard&quot; src=&quot;/assets/CoolBoard.png&quot; width=&quot;522&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the brief explanation given to me, I just had to give it a go.  It looks simple enough, but I soon found out it was anything but simple.  The first challenge is getting upright and balanced and then maintaining that balanced position. I&#39;ve used it for about 30 mins a day on 3 of the past 5 days (I didn&#39;t use it on the weekend) and I think I&#39;m starting to get the hang of it. Getting up, balanced and maintaining the balance is now possible, though I can&#39;t do it for much longer than about 30 to 60 seconds at a time.  I can certainly confirm it does a brilliant job of working your core muscles and the stabilising muscles in your legs and I&#39;m very impressed.  This simple little device provides quite a workout and it&#39;s way better than any other core stability device I&#39;ve used before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The goal now is to get up to a balanced position without any support and then hold the position for several minutes at a time.  When this becomes easy, I&#39;ll start complicating things by trying to squat or do other activities on the board.  Thankfully my colleague keeps this in the office, so I don&#39;t need to get one for myself (they&#39;re very expensive), though I wouldn&#39;t say no if Santa snuck one into my Christmas stocking this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully some regular balancing, along with my prescribed exercises, will have the desired effect and increase my core strength and completely and permanently relieve me of the discomfort I sometime feel in my right hip.

Since then, there has been a marked increase in their numbers and it&#39;s not uncommon to spot them circling over parts of west Berkshire, especially along the M4 corridor (hmmmmm, plenty of roadkill).  In fact, they&#39;re so common now, I find it odd not to see one on a clear day circling over the neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;I think it&#39;s pretty amazing to have birds of prey circling over my house and neighbourhood so I always take a moment to watch them for a while, especially when out running.  It adds a bit of interest to the run.  Anyway, yesterday when I went for my run, I spotted a red kite in the air as I made my way through Maiden Erleigh and watched is circle and glide and generally survey the &#39;hood.  I then watched it grow a pair of metaphorical balls and come right down and check me out.  The kite came literally within 2 meters of the top of my head and circled at that height two or three times before retreating back to the loftier heights. It was pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I&#39;ve seen a kite come this close to a human.  They don&#39;t even come this close when I&#39;m standing on the balcony of our second floor flat, so this was definitely a bold one.  Either that or I looked like a nice bit of tasty carrion - I&#39;m too big to be a mouse or other small mammal &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, come to think of it, the bird was probably on a fact-finding mission.  I&#39;m probably a hot topic of discussion in the red kite circles of west Berkshire and he probably just had to get a good look to find out if it was true: &lt;em&gt;does that man in the blue and black jacket &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; run without any shoes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the topic of red kites, the latter part of my run took me through an area of Woodley predominantly inhabited by the older generation, and I noticed a flock about about 10 to 15 of them circling and swooping down over one of the roads a few rows back from where I was running: I think maybe one of the old dears may have croaked it and fallen off her mobility scooter.  Easy pickings for some hungry kites &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Testosterone Decreases after Ingestion of Sugar</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/testosterone-decreases-after-ingestion-of-sugar\"/>\n   <updated>2010-10-30T08:28:00+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/testosterone-decreases-after-ingestion-of-sugar</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Wow!!

A brief explanation can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;http://peakperformance.runnersworld.com/2010/10/oct-21-a-new-science-is-born-computational-marathoning.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this Runner&#39;s World article&lt;/a&gt;.  Now the calculations involved are pretty complex, but thankfully you don&#39;t need to be a mathematician to take advantage of them.  Simply plug in your details into his easy to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://endurancecalculator.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt; (requires Java) and then get eating and running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With a bit of carbo-loading at my current age and fitness level (though I think this has been a bit over-simplified as it only relies on my current resting heart rate), apparently I should be able to do a sub-3 hour marathon without hitting the wall:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;EnduranceCalculatorResults.png&quot; src=&quot;/assets/EnduranceCalculatorResults.png&quot; width=&quot;508&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now whilst this is all well and good, it does concentrate on the use of carbohydrates as the primary fuel source, which is understandable.  I wonder how the results of this study would be affected by someone who&#39;s trained their body to primarily burn fat for fuel, like those on ketogenic diets or even someone on Atkins.  Whilst I know these aren&#39;t &quot;ideal&quot; competition diets by current convention, I have heard of ultra-marathon runners &quot;fat-loading&quot; to fuel them for their runs with great success.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Minimalist Running Shoes: Is Less More?</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/minimalist-running-shoes-is-less-more\"/>\n   <updated>2010-10-20T10:31:48+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/minimalist-running-shoes-is-less-more</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Quite a long and quite interesting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-240-400--13691-1-1X2X3X4X5X6X7X8-9,00.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; on the growing use of minimalist running shoes from Runner&#39;s World.

There&#39;s a slight nip in the air, the leaves are starting to fall and the squirrels are out in full force gathering nuts and seeds for the winter ahead. This is quite a stark contrast to what I&#39;ve just been enjoying for the last two weeks: hot sunny Spanish weather with no running, lots of swimming, food and beer, and not much else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just got back from my first run in just over two weeks following my belated summer holiday and what a wonderful run it was.  I felt full of bounce and seemed to just glide my way along. The cool nip in the air punctuated by dappled sunshine was very refreshing, and the feeling of the cool tar under my feet broken up by intermittent patches of freshly dropped leaves quite exhilarating.  Of course, I don&#39;t think the squirrels were too happy with me suddenly appearing behind or right next to them completely unannounced: there was a lot of squirrel screeching and scurrying and not too many happy squirrels, but hey-ho, that&#39;s what happens when a nutter like me works near a nice wooded area.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m looking forward to running barefoot this autumn.  Autumn is one of my favourite times to run and this year will be my first year completely barefoot.  I&#39;m also eager to see how far into winter I can go before I feel the need to wear shoes because of the cold.  If we don&#39;t get the snow we had last year, I may be able to make it all the way through. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">The Evolution of NB Minimus</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/evolution-of-nb-minimus\"/>\n   <updated>2010-10-06T15:36:01+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/evolution-of-nb-minimus</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;New Balance Minimus trail shoe&quot; src=&quot;/assets/NewBalanceMinimus.jpg&quot; width=&quot;405&quot; height=&quot;210&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;New Balance recently released an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newbalance.com/performance/tony-krupicka-and-chris-wawrousek-talk-about-the-evolution-of-nb-minimus/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; between ultramarathon runner &lt;a href=&quot;http://antonkrupicka.blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tony Krupicka&lt;/a&gt;, a New Balance shoe designer Chris Wawrousek and someone acting on behalf of NewBalance.com that goes over the iterative design process behind the NB Minimus Trail shoe due out in 2011.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty interesting stuff, and I quite like the little slide show towards the end showing each of the iterative steps in the design process.

I&#39;ve just been incredibly busy at work and when not at work, I&#39;ve been frantically coding a new PHP based API wrapper - &lt;a href=&quot;http://phpzenfolio.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;phpZenfolio&lt;/a&gt; - for the guys at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zenfolio.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zenfolio&lt;/a&gt;. All this busy-ness saps inspiration, but I&#39;m feeling a bit inspired to write an update, so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Running&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First, the important part: the running.  What&#39;s happening with the running?  Well, I&#39;m still doing it and am now back on track and running as I was before my injury.  I&#39;m diligently sticking to a 5k training programme from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Brain-Training-Runners-Revolutionary-Endurance/dp/0451222326/barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brain Training for Runners&lt;/a&gt; to ensure I don&#39;t push things to soon, but also to actually give me a proper progressive and measurable training programme.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve gone for the 5k programme for a couple of reasons: &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s a moderate volume programme so I&#39;m not likely to be doing too much too soon.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All the training runs are well within the limits of being able to do them completely barefoot.  The 10k programme starts to push things to the point where I would likely be running on sensitive feet quite often which would severely affect my ability to actually train at the required intensity, but also affect the build up of the skin and flesh under my feet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve always been better at the shorter distances than the long and I think concentrating on 5k for a while will do me the world of good in the long run.  The increased emphasis on speed will definitely help with the 10ks later.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also still running barefoot, though I am starting to &quot;warm up&quot; my Evos and huaraches in preparation for winter.  I plan to run for as long as possible barefoot, but just in case we get another severe winter like last year, I want to be sure I don&#39;t get any blisters when I switch to using one of these for any extended period of time later when my mileage is higher.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;My Back&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things are going well with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/finally-sorting-my-back-out&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;back&lt;/a&gt; or more precisely my right SI joint and lower back. I now have a diagnosis: a hypo-mobile right sacroiliac joint most likely caused by the use of my abs and hamstrings when I should be using my glutes and pelvic muscles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been given some SI joint stretches to do 3 times a day along with a progressively longer list of pelvic exercises designed to strengthen my pelvic muscles and teach my body to engage my pelvic muscles rather than handing control to my abs or hamstrings.  These are surprisingly simple exercises, but they take a bit of concentration to do right and it takes a while to get into the swing of things.  Things like pelvic tilts and pelvic bridges.  Simple exercises, but in someone &quot;hamstring-centric&quot; like me, it&#39;s tough forcing myself to disengage my hamstrings and let my other muscles do the work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One thing is for certain, the pain is significantly reduced and I think I&#39;m starting to notice the benefit of these exercises in my running.  The physio did mention this would be a consequence and would actually benefit my running.  With this bit of news, I have some renewed enthusiasm to keep performing the exercises and make sure I&#39;m doing them right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a &quot;toe bone is connected to the finger bone&quot; sort of way, my hip problem is likely to have contributed to whatever caused my foot injury, if not being the primary cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Racing&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve decided to put all racing on the back-burner for the moment to concentrate on training and sorting out my hip/lower back problem.  This includes the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reading Parkruns&lt;/a&gt;.  Whilst these aren&#39;t formal races, they do have a race feel to them and I can&#39;t help but push and race them, especially now I&#39;ve cracked 20 mins more often than not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on the weather and how my training goes, I may pick up running the Parkruns in November, maybe December.  I&#39;ll certainly be picking them up again before summer next year &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all, things are going well with me.  I&#39;ve got a few weeks holiday coming up, so running will take a bit of a backseat but I&#39;ll be back refreshed and rearing to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Comments Working Again</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/comments-working-again\"/>\n   <updated>2010-09-27T16:34:55+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/comments-working-again</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Oooops, I updated the underlying code of this site a while ago and completely forgot that the comment form functionality changed.

Yes? Ah, but do you really? If you&#39;re thinking I&#39;m referring to golfers, think again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to the new breed of British runners, yes runners, who now have a handicap. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runbritain.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;runbritain&lt;/a&gt; has just introduced a new handicap scoring system that is designed to give road runners of all abilities the ability to benchmark their progress and compare their results across a range of distances and terrains.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To quote the runbritain Rankings site:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scoring system, which has been developed in conjunction with the team behind the McCain Power of 10 website, rewards regular racing and factors in a degree of difficulty for slower courses. The score is derived from your results at 5K, 10K, Half Marathon &amp; Marathon during 2010 and thereafter on a rolling 12 month basis although you only need to have done one race in 2010 to claim a handicap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runbritainrankings.com/user/claimhandicap.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;registered&lt;/a&gt;, you just need to enter at least one race you&#39;ve run this year and then be amazed at your handicap which will be in the range of -2 for the elites and 36 in 0.1 increments.  Keep adding race results and watch your handicap adjust.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Everytime you login, you&#39;ll be taken to your personal biography page which displays:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;current rankings at each distance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;personal progress graph&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;direct comparisons with other runners with a &#39;head-to-head&#39; function&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;handicap score updated automatically after each run&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; target times to bring score down to the next level&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;training schedules to help you achieve your targets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So if you haven&#39;t done so already, head on over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runbritainrankings.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;runbritain Rankings&lt;/a&gt; and claim your handicap.  Oh and don&#39;t forget to bring up your handicap when chatting over that ice cold beer after your next race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the curious, my handicap after three 5k Parkruns and two 10k races is...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;My runbritain Rankings Handicap&quot; src=&quot;/assets/handicap.png&quot; width=&quot;163&quot; height=&quot;119&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... with all races done completely barefoot.

I can&#39;t pin-point any one action that causes the discomfort or anything that aggravates it, but it seems to crop up every 3 to 4 months and then hangs about for a month or two.  Then all is well until it&#39;s next occurrence several months later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have managed to work out that if I am feeling the discomfort, it&#39;s easier for me to take things one step further into the world of excruciating pain if I sit a bit wonky on the sofa and get up without correcting my posture first.  Thankfully I can catch this just as it starts to pinch and avoid the pain, though I have caught myself 3 times &quot;pinching&quot; something without any warning. This has left me almost immobile for a week at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As this seems to be a recurrent thing that isn&#39;t going away, I&#39;m off to the physio today to get a full assessment. Hopefully that will shed some light on the cause and provide a means to resolve it.  I suspect it may be due to my slightly wonky spine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the running side of things, the last two weeks have been good.  No problems with my running at all and I&#39;m feeling great.  I&#39;m deliberately taking things quite slowly so I don&#39;t introduce any problems and have decided to follow a more structured training programme.  Hopefully the gradual increase in volume and pace will keep things on course for a cracking race in about 16 weeks time.  Until then I&#39;ll be keeping the racing to a bare minimum.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Wooohooo!!! I&#39;m Running Again</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/wooohooo-im-running-again\"/>\n   <updated>2010-08-21T14:24:45+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/wooohooo-im-running-again</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Woohooo!!!! I&#39;m running again folks and boy does it feel good to be back out there running. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been just over 6 weeks since I &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/tofp-probably-stress-fracture&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hurt my foot&lt;/a&gt; and I decided yesterday was the day to finally head out and test how my foot has recovered.  I can say it was a great success.  I took a gentle 1 mile out-and-back run and all felt good.  I could feel a slight niggle on the top of my left foot during the early stages but this soon disappeared as my muscles relaxed and I adjusted my form.  As I was feeling so good, I threw in 4 sets of 10 &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burpee_(exercise)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;burpees&lt;/a&gt; with each set immediately followed by a fast 50m run.  Wow these felt good.  It was tough towards the end but quite exciting to feel what it feels like to run on legs that feel like jelly again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, my legs and feet all feel tip-top this morning, so 6 weeks off hasn&#39;t de-conditioned me much.  That said, my feet are a bit more sensitive now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The time not running wasn&#39;t all lost time.  During this time I have discovered quite a bit about my stride, feet and legs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Top of the Foot Pain Relief&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is quite an obscure one, but I found that using a pair of lovely pink &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000P5W0GM?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000P5W0GM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;toe separators&lt;/a&gt; - yes the type ladies use for painting their toe nails - actually relieved some of the pain I was feeling on the top of my foot.  I have no idea why, but it works and whilst it got uncomfortable after prolonged use, it was a brilliant way of relieving the pain at it&#39;s peak.  I&#39;m going to continue to use the toe separators each night whilst watching telly to see if it has any effect on spreading my toes and thus giving a wider more stable platform to run on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;It Twists&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The niggle on the top of my foot showed me that my left foot twists ever-so-slightly when pushing off when walking. I could feel it with each stride. My heel twists inwards as I roll over the ball of my foot.  As I couldn&#39;t run when I discovered this, I can&#39;t say if I have this same &quot;feature&quot; when running, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if I do, especially as concentrating on NOT twisting and NOT pushing off whilst running seemed to ease the twinge I felt at the early stages of yesterday&#39;s run. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Knee Bone Connected to Toe Bone&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I also got my hands on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002JJQSOW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=costest-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B002JJQSOW&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;15cm x 90cm foam roller&lt;/a&gt; and was very surprised to find I had quite a few tight spots in my hamstrings and calves.  My legs generally feel good and well relaxed so I was quite surprised to find these deep hidden knots.  What is interesting is relaxing some of the knots in my calves, particularly my left calf, also relieved some of the pain in my foot; I could actually feel the tension easing away from the tendons on the top of my foot whilst pressing on one of the knots. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So whilst having an injury isn&#39;t the best thing in the world, it&#39;s turned out to be quite beneficial for me.  I now know that my left foot probably has a tendency to twist as I run and hence the possible cause of the injury.  I now know that toe separators aren&#39;t just for girls and I&#39;m also aware that I have unknowingly tight muscles, or more specifically tight areas of muscle fascia which will benefit from regular and consistent deep tissue massage or &quot;foam rollering&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Terra Plana are Hosting Barefoot Experience Workshops</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/terra-plana-are-hosting-barefoot-experience-workshops\"/>\n   <updated>2010-08-12T17:29:53+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/terra-plana-are-hosting-barefoot-experience-workshops</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I know this is a bit short notice, but I&#39;ve been a tad on the excessively busy side of things are work and really haven&#39;t wanted to touch a computer when I got home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in taking the plunge into barefoot running, but want to be sure you&#39;re doing it right or with a bit of guidance, why not take advantage of the Barefoot Experience Workshops Terra Plana are hosting next week...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Learn the skill of barefoot walking and running at &#39;The Barefoot Experience&#39; Terra Plana, 36 Kings Road, London SW3.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Spearheaded by new research and the international bestseller &#39;Born to Run&#39; the barefoot movement is gathering pace.

Being one eager to see how others can learn about barefoot running, I graciously accepted Jason&#39;s offer and a couple of weeks later a copy of his booked dropped through the letterbox.  Thanks Jason.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing that struck me was the size of the book, or more precisely the lack there of.  The book is A5 in dimensions and has only 52 pages of reading material, excluding the exercises and appendix at the back, however the lack of size is easily made up by the wealth of information contained within.  The book is broken up into 5 progressive sections: &lt;em&gt;Why Barefoot Running, Pre-running, Starting to Run Barefoot, Intermediate Barefoot Running&lt;/em&gt; and finally &lt;em&gt;Other Topics&lt;/em&gt; which covers things like hecklers, training and cross training. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Each section is broken into individual points explaining a concept, activity or issue, and provides a clear description of each as it guides you from the very beginning up to the point of being a relatively seasoned barefoot runner. As the whole book is written as a series of progressive points, it does make it feel a bit &quot;jumpy&quot; when reading it cover-to-cover.  I got the feeling that it may have come from a collection of blog posts compiled into a single book.  However this structure does make it an easy reference to turn to if you need to check up on something quickly so it&#39;s perfectly suited to the beginner who would otherwise spend the time trawling the web for answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the structure and layout of the book out of the way, I can say Jason does a good job of introducing the complete beginner to the world of barefoot running.  He starts off by correctly pointing out that barefoot and minimalist running may not be for everyone, whether that be due to medical or preferential reasons, but does mention that it&#39;s definitely worth considering, even if just as a supplement to your normal shod running.  He also references several studies on the effects of modern running shoes, but doesn&#39;t go to the point of bashing the manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jason then takes the reader through a deliberately slow and relaxed approach to getting ready for barefoot running, relaxing (this is very important and Jason puts a lot of emphasis on this), strengthening the feet and skin, and then finally heading out for a run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just before the reader actually heads out for their first run, the topics of cadence, form and posture are covered and then once out running things are progressed nicely to cover efficiency, different terrains, weather and increasing speed and distance.  The book then finishes off covering developing your training further and incorporating cross training for development of the rest of your body.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I do have a few criticisms with the book.  First is its price: I didn&#39;t have to pay for my copy, but others may be a bit disappointed by the size of the book compared to it&#39;s price, however the book is self published so the costs will be higher. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; alt=&quot;The Barefoot Running Book - Second Edition Cover&quot; src=&quot;/assets/BarefootBook-JB2ndEd.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; /&gt;Next is Jason&#39;s suggestion that people find the form that feels right for them.  My own experience is showing that this is not the best approach.  Form is important and whilst the comfortable form it easy to fall into and get used to, it may not be the best and without correction injury may ensue. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, and this isn&#39;t really a criticism, but a niggle: the cover it terrible.  I wouldn&#39;t pick this book up when passing it on a shelf in the book shop.  Thankfully for Jason, he&#39;s been told this already, or worked it out for himself as the next edition is coming with a much more attractive cover (see right).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In summary, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Barefoot-Running-Book-Practical-Minimalist/dp/0615354440/barefootrunner-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Barefoot Running Book&lt;/a&gt; is a good, easily referenced, introduction to barefoot running for anybody interested in taking up barefoot running, or just incorporating a bit of barefoot running into their training schedule.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And for those on the bleeding edge of technology, it&#39;s available for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kindle-Wireless-Reader-3G-Wifi-Graphite/dp/B002LVUWFE/barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt; in both the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Barefoot-Running-Book-Minimalist-ebook/dp/B003PJ7BX2/barefootrunner-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; AND even the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Barefoot-Running-Book-Practical-Minimalist/dp/B003PJ7BX2/barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">How to Start Running In Minimalist Shoes</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/how-to-start-running-minimalist-shoes\"/>\n   <updated>2010-07-27T16:42:56+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/how-to-start-running-minimalist-shoes</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I received the following query in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-the-forest-five-2010#comment-496&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;br /&gt;\nI&#39;m a Physio based in Guildford. I&#39;ve been looking into barefoot running for the last 6 months having had repetitive shin splints from running in expensive shoes-and finally found some fivefingers on sale. So I&#39;ve taken the plunge and ordered some kso&#39;s to test the whole barefoot running out of both personal and professional interest. Can I ask, how did you start out? What sort of training plan would you advise?&lt;br /&gt;\nThanks,&lt;br /&gt;\nJoe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started to write a response to the comment in the comments section of that post and realised it was becoming a rather long response and should probably warrant it&#39;s own post so others can find it too.  So here it is and sorry about the delay in writing it Joe, it&#39;s been a crazy few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;It&#39;s been just over a year since &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/no-more-shoes&quot;&gt;I declared I wouldn&#39;t run in normal running shoes&lt;/a&gt; ever again. Since then I&#39;ve transitioned to running completely barefoot and built up a fair bit of knowledge and experience and with hindsight on my side, I wouldn&#39;t recommend the route I took.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I came into barefoot running by going the minimalist route first, specifically in Vibram Five Fingers, and whilst I took things slowly (&lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals-on-hold-for-the-moment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;only after taking things too fast and feeling a bit tender at times&lt;/a&gt;), I still think I didn&#39;t spend enough time on working on my form in the early days when running in the Vibrams.  As a result I&#39;ve built up a good base for barefoot running, but I think I&#39;ve still got some sort of form issues and hence the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/tofp-probably-stress-fracture&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;injury&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;m currently sitting with.  If I were to do things all over again, I would start completely barefoot, perfect my form and then transition to the Vibrams or other minimalist shoes and I recommend anyone else considering making the transition do the same thing.  (Actually, I wouldn&#39;t go to the VFF now &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The idea of transitioning to minimalist shoes by going completely barefoot may sound counter-intuitive, but it&#39;s not really. Starting out barefoot, rather than in Vibrams or other minimalist shoes, will ensure you have the perfect &quot;coach&quot; by your side, or more precisely under you.  Your bare feet will start off very weak, very soft and very sensitive.  This weakness and sensitivity will act as the perfect guide to ensuring you don&#39;t over do things and they&#39;ll allow you to very quickly and easily assess if you&#39;re going too far or too fast and if you have any form issues that need ironing out.   By starting in the minimalist shoes, you&#39;ll have a thin layer of rubber between your soft sensitive feet and the ground.  Whilst not significant, it&#39;s enough to dull some of the sensations your feet could be experiencing and thus reduce the feedback you get.  This in turn will encourage you to go too far, too fast, too soon without ensuring good form and you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; get hurt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now with that out of the way, I highly recommend you read through and action &lt;strong&gt;ALL&lt;/strong&gt; of Ken Bob Saxton&#39;s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/?page_id=525&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How to Run&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and build yourself a good barefoot base before slipping on the Vibrams.  Ken Bob is probably the most experienced barefoot runner in the western world and he&#39;s done a tremendous job of documenting the process of learning to run barefoot correctly.  Any attempts I make would pale in comparison and I&#39;m not confident I have enough experience just yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Only when you&#39;re easily and comfortably running 3 - 5 km completely barefoot do I think you should consider transitioning to the Vibrams or other minimalist shoes, if of course you still want to go this route &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .  This should give you a good base and should ensure your feet and lower legs are trained well for the task with your form as close to perfect as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This may not play well into any racing plans or other short-term dreams you may have, but putting them on hold and starting from rock bottom and building up is &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; the best thing to do to ensure a long and rewarding, and hopefully injury free, minimalist or barefoot running career.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Phys Ed: Do Certain Types of Sneakers Prevent Injuries?</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/do-certain-types-of-sneakers-prevent-injuries\"/>\n   <updated>2010-07-22T08:01:12+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/do-certain-types-of-sneakers-prevent-injuries</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;In a word: Nope.

Have I done this right?  Did I do that wrong? Could I have done something different?  And that&#39;s when it struck me: yes I could have done something different.  I could have put my ego/desires in my pocket and listened to my body, but I didn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;It was whilst reviewing the training log entry I made for my run on 22 June that the penny dropped...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill piggies barefoot&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted a hill session, but was in the mood for making it a bit of a stinker so I did doggies (pyramids of 200m, 400m, 600m, 800m, 800m, 600m, 400m, 200m fast with equal recovery between each to other people) but as each fast rep it uphill, I called them piggies. Unfortunately I developed a bit of a twinge on the top of left foot on the 2nd fast 800m so stopped after that rep and didn&#39;t do the whole stack. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Felt good and felt as though I could have come back down the other side of the stack, but better safe than sorry. I don&#39;t want to injure myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What I didn&#39;t document was the beginning of this training session.  As I set off out of the office, I felt a little discomfort in my left foot.  At the time it felt like a joint in my foot hadn&#39;t &quot;popped&quot; yet - that feeling you get when you think you need to crack a knuckle or something to release a bit of tension or pressure.  I&#39;ve encountered these in my toes and ankles for years (as a kid, all my joints used to &quot;pop&quot; after a period of inactivity which was a bit embarrassing in a huge dead quiet school hall at a prize giving ceremony) and thought this was another one of those occasions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It took nearly 7km of running for my body to tell me in no uncertain terms that this wasn&#39;t one of those occasions.  All through this run, I kept trying to pop the joints in my foot to relieve the feeling of needing to pop them, but the pops weren&#39;t coming and neither was the sensation dissipating.  The final twinge on the last 800m that I did was my body telling me in no uncertain terms: &lt;strong&gt;STOP!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My foot was then tender for just over week.  Had I listened to my body when I first set out, I probably wouldn&#39;t have had the discomfort during the run, the discomfort during the next week and a bit and the pain that struck at just after the 8km mark in the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hindsight is a wonderful thing from which I need to learn.  Like a naughty schoolboy, I&#39;ve been told off by my body for not doing as I was told and now I&#39;m paying the price.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So if this post has to have a take away message it&#39;s: &lt;strong&gt;listen to your body&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is continually preached in the barefoot running circles, and I&#39;ve preached it myself, but now I need to actually take heed and start to really listen.  I need to, and will, err on the side of caution from here on in.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">How Do You Ride Your Bike Then?</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/how-do-you-ride-your-bike-then\"/>\n   <updated>2010-07-17T12:36:58+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/how-do-you-ride-your-bike-then</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I worked from home yesterday and decided I&#39;d go for a gentle walk up to the local park and back to get a bit of exercise and to keep my feet used to being barefoot.  On the way back I was approached by a little boy on his bicycle.  He greeted me, which was quite refreshing, and then asked &quot;&lt;em&gt;Why aren&#39;t you wearing any shoes?&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.  I replied: &quot;&lt;em&gt;Because I don&#39;t want to hurt my feet&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.  A puzzled look appeared on his face, a little pause and then he asked: &quot;&lt;em&gt;How do you ride your bike then? It hurts if I don&#39;t wear shoes&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.  He wasn&#39;t too interested in my response as he rode off, but his response made me smile.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">My ToFP is Probably a Stress Fracture</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tofp-probably-stress-fracture\"/>\n   <updated>2010-07-14T18:26:08+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tofp-probably-stress-fracture</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a week now since I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-yateley-10k-series-2010-race-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;second Yateley 10k&lt;/a&gt; in which I cracked 45 minutes, but also developed a pain on the top of my foot and I think the top-of-foot-pain (ToFP) may be a stress fracture of the 3rd metatarsal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;The morning after the race I woke up with one big fat and relatively sore left foot.  As long as I didn&#39;t wiggle my toes too vigorously or put any weight on my foot whilst it was flat on the ground, it was fine and pain free...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me: Doctor, it hurts when I do this.&lt;br /&gt;\nDr: Well, don&#39;t do that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Given it&#39;s rather large and tender state I hit the internet to do a bit of self-diagnosis.  After a bit of searching three, possibilities came up:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/cybertherapist/front/foot/extensor_tendons.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;extensor tendonitis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/cybertherapist/front/foot/metatarsal.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;metatarsal stress fracture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/cybertherapist/front/foot/mortons.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Morton&#39;s neuroma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Given the size and tenderness of the top of my foot (too big and tender to easily diagnose the above), I decided not to go to the doctor.  I didn&#39;t want to try driving and wasn&#39;t too confident they&#39;d be able to diagnose much from my fat foot without an X-ray, and even then there&#39;s a good chance they wouldn&#39;t be able to see a problem.  If it was one of the first two, there&#39;s also very little that could be done anyway.  I&#39;m also a firm believer in if it&#39;s something you can heal yourself without any problems or too much discomfort, then don&#39;t waste the NHS&#39;s time and money - there are much sicker and more broken people than me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Instead I spent the next few days resting and icing my foot at regular intervals.  This did a good job of reducing the pain and swelling to the point where I could try a bit more self-diagnosis.  Based on the information at the above links and other places on the internet, I ruled out Morton&#39;s neuroma very quickly - the pain is too high up on the top of my foot.  With a bit more poking and prodding and toe wiggling, I think I&#39;ve narrowed it down to a stress fracture of the 3rd metatarsal: I can easily pin-point the exact spot on the top of my foot where it hurts and it&#39;s consistent with the symptoms of a stress fracture.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now to try and work out how I got the stress fracture in the first place.  I have a few theories, and these are really just that: theories and a few accompanying thoughts about each:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sloppy form on my left side:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months I have noticed that my left ankle has felt a bit stiff and tender after the longer runs.  I didn&#39;t feel this on my right ankle, so one possible theory is I&#39;m not relaxing my left ankle enough just before impact and thus not allowing the impact to be absorbed properly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There could also be a twisting action or incorrect landing as I found during the race the twisting my foot inwards slightly seems to reduce the pain on the top of my foot.  That said, that could have just been a coping mechanism and not really indicative of an odd landing, especially as I haven&#39;t had a blister on my left foot in a long long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad form whilst racing in Vibrams earlier in the month:&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the middle of June I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-the-forest-five-2010&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Forest Five&lt;/a&gt; and as it was off road on terrain too rough to go barefoot, I ran in my Vibrams.  It&#39;s certainly quite possible that under race conditions, with less sensory feedback, that I could have slammed my feet down a bit harder than usual and set things in motion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m doubtful this is the primary cause as I didn&#39;t actually experience any discomfort during or after this race, but I suppose just enough damage could have been done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General over use and my left foot just happened to be the weakest link:&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the months and weeks building up to the second race I&#39;d increased my mileage quite a bit and also threw in quite a few races. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m doubtful the mileage is the cause as I&#39;ve been quite good at increasing this slowly, however the racing could be partly responsible as it&#39;s harder to keep good form at pace, especially the 5k&#39;s on grass in which I&#39;ve caught myself several times running with a slightly different form.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So with these thoughts out on paper, so to speak, I&#39;m inclined to believe the cause of the stress fracture is probably the first theory with a little bit of the third, so I&#39;ll be paying special attention to my form on my return to running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a self-certified doctor - Dr Seymour PhD has a nice ring to it &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; - I&#39;ve put myself on a 4 to 6 week break from running to give my foot a chance to heal.  Sadly this means I&#39;ll probably miss the 3rd of the Yateley 10k races, but that&#39;s a small price to pay for longevity in barefoot running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be keeping my fitness levels up with a lot of cycling, rowing and a few weights sessions so hopefully I won&#39;t lose too much fitness. I&#39;ll also be doing as much walking around barefoot as possible to try and ensure my feet don&#39;t soften up too much either. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Who knows, I may come back stronger and fitter than I went out.  Actually, it would be good if I come back a bit lighter too.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Race Report: Yateley 10k Series 2010 - Race 2</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-yateley-10k-series-2010-race-2\"/>\n   <updated>2010-07-09T11:09:26+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-yateley-10k-series-2010-race-2</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Wednesday evening saw the running of the second of the three &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yateley10kseries.info/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yateley 10k races&lt;/a&gt; in the series, and like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/yateley-10k-series-race-1-completed-barefoot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first one&lt;/a&gt;, I ran it barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d had a bit of a sedentary two weeks building up to the race following the onset of the early signs of the dreaded top of foot pain (ToFP) that cropped up during my piggies hill training session on 22 June.  With only a single tabata rowing session done between then and the race I went in the race very relaxed and rested with my foot feeling good too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;At 7:30pm we were sent on our way and I paid special attention to my pace.  I went into this race wanting to crack 45 minutes and intended on doing so by keeping a constant pace that sat in the 4:20 min/km to 4:28 min/km range.  This plan worked beautifully.  I managed to remain disciplined and didn&#39;t get caught up in the excitement of the start of the race too much and managed to keep my pace more or less within this range right up until the 8th km.  This included the particularly stoney tarred section along Reading road between about 5.5km and 7.2km which this time I chose not to try and avoid. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect I could have kept this pace up beyond the 8km mark had it not been for what happened next...  just after the 8km mark the pain on the top of my left foot returned, and with a vengeance.  It was pretty damn painful, but as I&#39;d got most of the way round, there was no way I was going to stop now - I&#39;ll probably regret this later.  I quickly found it wasn&#39;t as painful if I turned my foot inwards slightly and almost rolled over my big toe (could the cause of the pain be due to a slightly outward pointing left foot?) so with my slightly adjusted gait and slower pace I headed for the finish.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Turning into the field entrance I glanced at my watch and noticed I was still on course for a sub-45 10k, so I floored it as best I could, passed a couple of people and crossed the finish line with a new PB: 44:43.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pleased as punch I handed in my timing chip, grabbed a water and a choccy bar and headed back to the car.  The pain in my left foot starting to really sink in now too.  Impressively I had my official results SMS by the time I got back to my car too...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/Yateley 10k 2010 - Race 2.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Yateley 10k Series 2010 Race 2 Results&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Yateley 10k 2010 - Race 2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; title=&quot;705 finishers this time&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all, I had a great run, except for the onset of ToFP at 8km, but that&#39;s incidental really as I&#39;d managed to set a new PB and still had a great time.  Still no sign of any photos from this or the previous race though - I&#39;m starting wonder if they had an official photographer this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&#39;ll have to see what happens with my left foot over the next few weeks.  Hopefully it&#39;ll recover completely in time for the 3rd and final race in the series on 4 August.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Race Report: The Forest Five 2010</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-the-forest-five-2010\"/>\n   <updated>2010-06-23T10:30:51+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-the-forest-five-2010</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Better late than never.  Last Wednesday saw me take on my first imperial distance race (we only do metric distances in South Africa): &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forestrunners.org.uk/events/forestfive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Forest Five&lt;/a&gt; (mile) at The Look Out in Bracknell and what a fantastic evening and offroad race it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/racing-offroad-research-it-first&quot;&gt;the test run I did on the Monday&lt;/a&gt;, I had intended on running in my huaraches, but then common sense prevailed and I opted to run in my Vibrams instead.  I decided not to run in the huaraches as I&#39;ve not done much running in them yet and the last thing I wanted were blisters from the different style of footwear, especially likely as I&#39;m not too sure I&#39;ve got them properly adjusted yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My wife very generously offered to drive me to the race and we arrived with about half an hour to spare.  As I pre-registered online I already had my number so had plenty time to locate the race start - it&#39;s a little walk into the forest - and warm up.  It was a very pleasant evening, so getting warm wasn&#39;t a problem.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;At just after 19:30 we were sent on our way by the most feeble sounding airhorn I&#39;ve ever heard, or didn&#39;t. The air part was there, just the horn part made no sound at all: should have used a vuvuzela &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .  As usual, I set off a little quick, but I managed to ensure it wasn&#39;t too quick and soon settled into a pace of about 4:20/km.  The route was slightly different from the one I found online and ran on the Monday, but only in the last half of the race in which they brought us back in a large arc which included a lot more little ups and downs than the original route.  This added a nice challenge and I suspect caught a few of those who&#39;ve run the old route a little by surprise.  They did however warn us at the beginning that it was a slightly different route, though I couldn&#39;t hear why.  My watch also reported the route to be slightly shorter than 5 miles, but I think we can attribute this to the tree coverage over large parts of the route - the race organisers assured us the route is accurately measured.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As can be expected, my Vibrams lived up to expectations and protected my feet enough for me to maintain a nice fast pace without blocking too much feedback.  They also draw a lot of funny looks and even a couple of comments with one chap commenting on having read Born to Run, but not being brave enough to try barefoot or Vibrams.  I encouraged him to give barefoot a go and he then bid farewell and left me in hist dust &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, this was a very pleasant race.  It was a relatively small field, on a fabulous evening in a beautiful settings.  This is definitely a race I&#39;ll be doing again.  This part of Bracknell forest will also be getting a lot more visits from me too: it&#39;s a fantastic area to run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forestrunners.org.uk/files/bfrfiles/documents/forestv/2010/img-618163026-0001.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official results&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 34:34&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Overall Position&lt;/strong&gt;: 56 / 327&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Age Category Position&lt;/strong&gt;: 28&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Evoskins From Inov-8</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/evoskins-from-inov-8\"/>\n   <updated>2010-06-19T08:48:05+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/evoskins-from-inov-8</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yfrog.com/jmv0ulj&quot;&gt;Spotted&lt;/a&gt; on t&#39;interweb thingy. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Evoskins.jpg&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Evoskins.jpg&quot; style=&quot;max-width:98%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Surely these can&#39;t be for real.

Tomorrow I will be running the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forestrunners.org.uk/events/forestfive&quot;&gt;Forest Five&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s &quot;&lt;em&gt;5 miles along forest tracks of grass and gravel through the scenic Windsor Forest&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. Sounds good, but can I run it barefoot?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not being one to be beaten by a bit of dirt, I headed out yesterday for a very gentle barefoot run over the course, or at least what I think is the course - with the aid of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0025UHKNS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=costest-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0025UHKNS&quot;&gt;Garmin Forerunner 405CX&lt;/a&gt; I followed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mapmyrun.com/run/united-kingdom/the-lookout-bracknell-berkshire/533795531&quot;&gt;this route&lt;/a&gt; - to see if I can actually run it barefoot.  If I could, I&#39;d run the race barefoot too, but until I&#39;d covered the whole route, I couldn&#39;t be sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Well, I can say I certainly &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, but I &lt;em&gt;won&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; be racing that route barefoot.  Most of the route is on nice forest floor roads and they&#39;re quite gentle on the feet so I was easily able to keep up a pace of about 5:30/km (nice and slow).  However there is about a 2 km stretch along the back which is definitely not barefoot friendly. There are lots of rocks and pointy stones and very little space to avoid them.  Over this section I saw my pace drop to around 9:30/km as I minced my way along and I honestly can&#39;t see how I&#39;d do that leg any quicker without a bit of protection on my feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So with that bit of research done, I&#39;ve decided I&#39;ll be running the Forest Five tomorrow in my huaraches (I must write about these at some point).  I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve done my little bit of pre-race research as I certainly wouldn&#39;t want to have shown up eager to race barefoot only to find everyone laughing at me as I hobbled along those two tough kilometres. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re planning on a barefoot race, research the route first, especially if part of it will be offroad.  You won&#39;t regret taking the time to do so.  If it&#39;s not possible, err on the side of caution until you are sure your feet can handle the toughest ground nature can throw at you.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Barefoot Reading Parkrun Three</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-reading-parkrun-three\"/>\n   <updated>2010-06-12T13:44:01+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-reading-parkrun-three</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Headed out for my third &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/&quot;&gt;Reading Parkrun&lt;/a&gt; on my own this morning.

Each year, I hear the guys talking about the races so I thought this would be a great re-introduction to road running and my first official race in the UK (at the time I registered I hadn&#39;t planned on doing any of the Parkruns).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;My wife and I made our way over to Yateley and got there for about 18:30 giving me plenty of time to collect my number, timing chip (the race uses Championchips for timing), warm up, queue for the little boys room (I felt like a lady having to queue for the loo) and then make my way into the funnel that is the start of the race.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At 19:31 we were all sent on our way.  Everyone except me were wearing shoes, those crazy fools &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .   The race took us out of the school grounds onto the road.  It was then a moderate climb up to the 3km mark, downhill with a little bump to the 5km mark for our first water station.  Just beyond that we turned onto Reading road for a long lonely flat slog of just short of 2km before turning off, past a sponges station, the 7km mark and another water station and made our way back towards the start/finish with a short little hill just near the 9km mark to keep things interesting and to sap a little bit of that energy you saved for the final sprint home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I thought this was a great route.  Not excessively challenging, but challenging enough to keep it interesting.  From a barefoot perspective, most of the route is very pleasant to run on.  The only places I encountered a bit of difficulty due to excessively large stones in the tar (and a bit of fatigue) was along Reading Road between the 6 and 8km marks and a little section on Firgrove Road just before you go round the roundabout up towards Waitrose.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And now for my results:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/Yateley 10k - Race 1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Yateley 10k - Race 1 Results&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Yateley 10k - Race 1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; title=&quot;There were 694 finishers in total.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, the race uses Championchips for timing.  Thankfully I knew about this before the event so purchased a triathlon timing chip ankle strap to hold my chip. I&#39;m quite impressed with my time, especially the chip time which indicates the time it took me to cover the 10km.  I definitely think a sub-45 is on the cards next time, however I need to add more 10+ km training runs to teach my feet and body to cope with the tough stuff when I&#39;m tired.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all I had a great evening and am now most definitely hooked again.  I&#39;m already starting to look at other races to run other than the 3 Yateley races and have my eye on a few which involve offroad sections, so I&#39;ll have to run these in Vibrams.  Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to post a photo from the race when the official photos become available.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;No Parkrun today.  I&#39;m knackered from a week of insanely early shifts and the race and I know I&#39;d want to race the Parkrun.  Too much racing makes Colin a broken boy. Maybe next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Parkrun Two And a PB Too</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/parkrun-two-and-a-pb-too\"/>\n   <updated>2010-05-29T14:21:39+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/parkrun-two-and-a-pb-too</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;For the second week in a row that crazy nutter was there at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/&quot;&gt;Reading Parkrun&lt;/a&gt; running without any shoes.

I had a great run this morning, but unfortunately, I don&#39;t learn.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/reading-parkrun-barefoot&quot;&gt;Last week&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned I set off a bit fast, well this week I set off faster (3:25 for the first km) and found myself in the lead as we approached the bridge.  It was at this point I realised I was being silly and backed off a bit and settled into a pace of around 4:00/km - the pace I planned on running the whole race at. To be honest, I don&#39;t think I could have kept up a pace much quicker thanks to my blistering start.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That said, I can&#39;t really grumble too much about my fast start as it meant I managed to smash a whopping 28 seconds off my time from last week setting a new personal best (PB).  The overall pace of the race was a bit slower this week too, but I think everyone still had a great run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/Results/WeeklyResults.aspx?runSeqNumber=36&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; this week were:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 19:41&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Overall Position:&lt;/strong&gt; 14 / 127&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Age Category Position:&lt;/strong&gt; 3rd&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think that&#39;s a good bit of speed work in preparation for Wednesday&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yateley10kseries.info/&quot;&gt;Yateley 10k&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;ll be doing that barefoot (though probably not anywhere near as fast as this 5k) so if you&#39;re there, watch out for the crazy fool - I&#39;ll be the one in the red shirt &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and don&#39;t forget: &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/follow-the-comrades-marathon-online&quot;&gt;Comrades online&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Reading Parkrun Barefoot</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/reading-parkrun-barefoot\"/>\n   <updated>2010-05-23T09:36:08+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/reading-parkrun-barefoot</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Check it out, some crazy nutter did the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/&quot;&gt;Reading Parkrun&lt;/a&gt; yesterday morning completely barefoot...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Reading Parkrun - 22 May 2010&quot; src=&quot;/assets/BarefootParkrun.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;345&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And that nutter was &lt;strong&gt;ME&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .  Yes folks, I have now technically done my first race in over 10 years and I did it barefoot. I opted for a mostly grassy 5k and it was fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;I&#39;ve been contemplating doing the Reading Parkrun for a while now however have always been put off by the weather or the fact I had to make my decision to run by 6pm the night before.  Not anymore.  On Friday morning I heard the weather was due to be glorious this weekend, so I thought I&#39;d register for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Parkrun&lt;/a&gt; this weekend and give it a go.  Well, things have changed since I last considered doing the Parkrun as now you only need to register once, print off your barcode and take it along to ANY Parkrun in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.com/events.aspx&quot;&gt;country&lt;/a&gt;.  No more pre-registering the night before. Just turn up, run, and flash your barcode when they register your finish position.  Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So with myself registered and barcode printed, my wife and I got up early on Saturday morning and cycled down to Thames Valley Park.  The weather was wonderful, as predicted, and there was quite a turnout. Apparently there were a record 115 entrants in yesterday&#39;s run.  At 9am we were promptly started and things got off with a blistering pace. I somehow managed to get a little caught up in the excitement of it all and started off a little too quickly, but I soon settled into a comfortable pace and finished in a time of 20:09 - waaaaaay quicker than I was expecting.  I was only aiming for somewhere around 23:00, so I&#39;m chuffed to bits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, I suspect a lot of my great time has to do with the fact that the course is mostly grass.  There is a short section with a gravel path, but most of this has nice grassy verges so there&#39;s not need to continually run on the gravel.  The gravel wasn&#39;t completely avoidable but I didn&#39;t really have any issues with the sections I couldn&#39;t avoid.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/Results/WeeklyResults.aspx?runSeqNumber=35&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; were:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 20:09&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Overall Position:&lt;/strong&gt; 16 / 115&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Age Category Position:&lt;/strong&gt; 5th&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all it was a great run and I&#39;m glad to have done it.  I think I may have to get my bare feet down there more often too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and for those who don&#39;t know anything about Parkruns, essentially they are free relatively informal timed 5k runs run in parks all over the country, open to anyone and everyone (provided you&#39;re pre-registered and got your barcode).

It&#39;s being run a week Sunday (30 May 2010) so start planning your lives now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last year was the first time it was done and it was a resounding success and this year the organisers plan on building on that by offering online coverage again, and constant Twitter updates at &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/comradesm2010&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/comradesm2010&lt;/a&gt; along with the usual TV and radio coverage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The race is a bit of a tradition in South Africa and my family.  Even if you&#39;re not competing, you&#39;re almost certain to know someone who is, so almost everyone spends the day following the events on TV or the radio.  Not being in South Africa anymore, this was a tradition I&#39;ve had to miss out on, but not anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This year&#39;s down run (from Pietermaritzburg to Durban) is sure to be a bumper one.  It&#39;s the 85th running of the race and it&#39;s drawn a whopping 23565 entries of which about 92% are expected to make it to the start line. If the past is anything to go by, we can expect well over 17500 finishers (about 75%).  That is just phenomenal and you can certainly understand why Comrades is the world&#39;s largest ultra-marathon. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Comrades is now back on my list of to-dos, though not sure I&#39;ll do it barefoot.

I consider myself to be a seasoned barefoot runner now, but I&#39;m eager to have a read through this book to see how closely my experience has been to that of the author&#39;s and also to see if I&#39;ve missed some &quot;magic trick&quot; or other little useful snippet that would help improve my barefoot running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;So, the first place I hit was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984382208?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=costest-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0984382208&quot;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve got a gift voucher that isn&#39;t transferable to Amazon.co.uk so thought I&#39;d use it for this book. Nope.  Sadly, the book isn&#39;t sold directly by Amazon, but rather by the publisher and they won&#39;t ship to the UK via Amazon.  The book also isn&#39;t available via Amazon.co.uk, nor any of the other European equivalents. So it&#39;s to the book&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barefootrunningbook.com/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, that&#39;s a bit of a dead end too - the cost of the P&amp;P is nearly as much as the book.  The book costs $24.95 and P&amp;P to the UK is $19.95.  Add to this the fact the Pound is sliding against the Dollar, by the time the book arrives in the UK I could soon find myself in the position where the book costs more than £18 and thus becomes liable to import duties (not VAT as books are exempt) and thus I&#39;d have paid more than double the price for the book.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Eager to find out if there is anyway I can get this in the UK without it costing me twice as much, I&#39;ve used the book site&#39;s contact form to find out.  I&#39;ll update you when I hear back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, if anyone knows of somewhere in Europe that is selling this book, then please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update - 19 May @ 18:30&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, Jessica Lee of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runbare.com&quot;&gt;RunBare&lt;/a&gt; has replied to my email already (I love it when people are prompt repliers):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;From\tJessica Lee\r\nTo\tColin Seymour\r\nDate\tWed, May 19, 2010 at 5:42 PM\r\nSubject\tRE: Purchasing from the UK\r\n\r\nHi Colin,\r\n\r\nI&#39;m sorry for your troubles.

As with the Aquas, the shoes come individually wrapped and beautifully presented in a box which encourages you to recycle or reuse it.  For those who like to see the contents, here you go...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-Whats-In-The/842832312_bdFnX-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/842832312_bdFnX-500x430.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo: What&#39;s in the Box&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Initial Observations&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-Side-Close-up/842832952_vbjSZ-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;/assets/842832952_vbjSZ-Th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo: Lacing&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First thing you&#39;ll notice is, unlike a lot of it&#39;s competitors, the VivoBarefoot Evos actually look like the running shoes you&#39;re used to seeing.  They have a very low profile, thanks to the very thin soles, feature a normal lacing system including the two eyes at the top so you can use your favourite &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/lacingmethods.htm&quot;&gt;lacing methods&lt;/a&gt; and generally don&#39;t look too dissimilar to a pair of racing flats.  You may also find yourself a little disappointed by the fact you don&#39;t get much in the way of padding, foam, rubber and fancy torsion or motion control systems for your £100 ($160).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Fit&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the initial observations out of the way, it was time to try them on. I didn&#39;t have much of a sizing &quot;experience&quot; with these as the lady who sent me the Aquas already had my size so the Evos came pre-sized and are a good fit.  The sizing of the Evos appears to be consistent with that of the Aquas, however you may want to get a size smaller if you&#39;re going to run in them without the insoles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The fit itself is good.  It&#39;s very comfortable with a relatively snug fit around the heel and midfoot and quite a spacious toebox, though not as spacious as the Aquas.  I suspect this can be attributed to the fact they&#39;re trying to make these look like running shoes and a super-wide toebox like on the aquas may look a little silly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The only &quot;issue&quot; I have with the fit, and it&#39;s more of an observation than an issue, is that the soles have a slight arch; the marketing calls it a  &quot;&lt;em&gt;sucked out arch area&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.  Unfortunately, this can be felt when wearing the shoes.  I only notice this because I&#39;ve been spending so much time completely barefoot or in the Aquas in which you can&#39;t feel this.  The arch isn&#39;t supportive in anyway so it&#39;s not going anything, however it&#39;s presence may lead to rubbing on longer runs.  Removing the insoles reduces the feeling, but doesn&#39;t take it away completely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-On-From-The/842833769_MZZcA-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/842833769_MZZcA-500x228.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo: How they look on me&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;228&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Construction&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Evos, like the Aquas, are immaculately constructed.  There are no distinguishable differences between the two shoes (bar the fact one&#39;s a left and one&#39;s a right) and no signs of sloppy or rushed construction.  They are relatively light and come in at about 271g with the insoles and 243g without (this is actually an average as the left weighs 10g more than the right for some reason) and there really isn&#39;t much to them.  The sole is 1mm thicker than the Aquas at 4mm throughout with absolutely no heel elevation what-so-ever.  The upper consists of a highly breathable &lt;acronym title=&quot;thermoplastic polyurethane&quot;&gt;TPU&lt;/acronym&gt; cage that is so breathable in fact that you can almost see straight through it.  Naturally this means the shoes are not water resistant, but then again, which running shoes are? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-Side/842833139_zcV7D-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/842833139_zcV7D-Th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo - TPU cage from the outside&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-TPU-Cage-1/842832754_uVpQE-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/842832754_uVpQE-Th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo - TPU cage from the inside (1)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-TPU-Cage-2/842832624_vEPPX-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/842832624_vEPPX-Th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo - TPU cage from the inside (2)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The sole of the shoes is a lot more rugged than the Aquas and pretty much all of the other minimalist running shoes on the market, however it does offer some additional grip in the wet and off road without too much loss of flexibility or ground feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What I couldn&#39;t answer by looking at the shoes was why they weigh so much when there&#39;s so little to them?.  A pair of mid-to-top of the range racing flats come in at about 100g lighter.  Maybe they&#39;ll lighten as they evolve.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Performance&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And finally we get to the part you&#39;re reading this review for: how do the Evos perform when you actually run in them? Very well indeed.  If you&#39;ve run in racing flats, they perform just as well, if not better.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the shoes protect your feet from the friction and coarseness of the road and that&#39;s about it.  There&#39;s no motion control, no arch support, no cushioning and no fancy gimmicks designed to make your feet behave like the manufacturer thinks they should.  The Evos allow your feet to behave as your feet want to behave with as little intervention from the shoe as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-Sole-Next-To/842833461_uG9nk-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; src=&quot;/assets/842833461_uG9nk-Th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo Sole vs the VivoBarefoot Aqua Sole&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The thin soles do a good job of softening the landing on some of the larger rocks and stones that may affect your stride when running barefoot, however they don&#39;t dampen things so much as to not give you any ground feedback at all.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s very close to what you&#39;d get from wearing Vibrams with the Vibrams giving a slightly higher degree of feedback.  That said, the slightly thicker and more rugged sole of the Evos trump the Vibrams when it comes to running on very stoney off-road paths.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can expect the ground feedback is affected by the insoles.  I&#39;ve taken the Evos out a couple of times with and without the insoles and I prefer them without the insoles, mainly because I actually noticed my feet hitting the ground slightly harder with the insoles than without; almost subliminally searching for the feedback.  This wasn&#39;t anywhere near as what I&#39;d expect my feet to do in normal shoes, but given I&#39;ve been running exclusively barefoot since the beginning of February, I noticed it if I concentrated.  If you&#39;re coming from running in normal shoes or racing flats, you&#39;ll appreciate the slightly extra cushioning that the insoles provide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is however one problem when it comes to running in the Evos: blisters.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In my first run in the Evos, I developed a smaller blister on my left heel.  I thought this may have been due to not running in shoes for a while, but it seems several other people have encountered this problem in their first few runs.  The incidence of the heel blisters seems to subside as the shoes wear and I didn&#39;t get any blisters on my heel on subsequent runs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The second and most notable incidence of blisters, and this is certainly the most common issue seen, is blisters or bruising on the top of either your big toe or the toe next to it.  When running, your foot naturally bends at the toes.  The TPU cage here creases inwards and presses against your toes. After several miles of this, you soon start to feel it and if you continue, as I did, you may develop a bruise and possibly a blister or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-Posed/842834291_sq27T-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/842834291_sq27T-500x333.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo: In a mid-stride pose - notice the creasing over the toes&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Terra Plana have acknowledged both of these issues and have apparently been back to the drawing board to resolve this in later releases of the shoes.  There&#39;s already talk on the haurache (note to self, I must make/get myself a pair of these) forum &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/huaraches/msg/6256d3ef23cdb76b&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; of the later editions looking ever-so slightly different around the heel and inside above the toes than the earlier version. If you have one of the early versions, you may find using a bit of moleskin fabric on the heel and above the toes as detailed &lt;a href=&quot;http://hhollines.blogspot.com/2010/03/evo-blister-solution.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; will solve your problems.  Hey, you could always try beg and plead with Terra Plana and see if they&#39;ll swap them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Summary&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Based on the early model I have tested, I can summarise the pros and cons as I see them as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Superb quality build and design.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Very thin soles throughout with no heel lift so the ground feedback is very good.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No support anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wide on the forefoot so your feet and toes can splay naturally.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They look like normal running shoes so will appeal to the more conscious runner.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cost.  Terra Plana know they&#39;re in a bit of a unique position in a niche market and have priced accordingly. Once competition picks up, I envisage the price of the Evos may come down.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The early revision is likely to cause blisters on the heel and on top of the toes and thus may require modification.  This con is probably moot given Terra Plana appear to have addressed this issue in later versions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Slightly narrow in midfoot, but this is likely to just be a personal thing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Whilst relatively lightweight, I can&#39;t help but feel they should be lighter especially.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re not barefoot - I had to put this one in there &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all, these are fantastic minimalist shoes and definitely ones I&#39;d recommend to anyone looking to move away from wearing traditional running shoes or any barefoot runner looking for a minimalist shoe to run in offroad or in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">100km Per Month</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/100km-per-month\"/>\n   <updated>2010-04-26T18:18:01+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/100km-per-month</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just uploaded today&#39;s run to FetchEveryone and noticed I&#39;ve clocked over 100km in a single month for the first time since my return to running, and the month isn&#39;t even over yet.

Whilst it&#39;s great to see barefoot running getting an article in Runner&#39;s World, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m too impressed with the overall slant of the article nor some of the points and quotes made.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;I&#39;m a bit late publishing this post as I&#39;ve been waiting patiently for permission to reproduce the article (I&#39;ve made a PDF copy) to accompany this post.  Sadly, my request has been completely ignored so you&#39;ll have to do with the pictures someone else has kindly put up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wrigleyjw/sets/72157623428426621/&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; (these may disappear).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The article starts off by giving you an idea of exactly how open the author is to the concept of barefoot running - he&#39;s not.  He&#39;d definitely prefer shelling out for &quot;&lt;em&gt;expensive, rubberised contraptions that make the business of running from A to B a comfortable, fashionable, pleasurable experience.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;  Fair enough, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but unfortunately, this puts a negative bias on the article right at the very beginning and the bias continues through the whole article. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the tone set, the author gives a relatively brief account of why barefoot running is seeing a lot more publicity recently with a nod to &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/book-born-to-run-by-christopher-mcdougall&quot;&gt;Born to Run&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/my-thoughts-on-the-lieberman-paper&quot;&gt;Lieberman paper&lt;/a&gt; and several other studies dealing with the possible benefits of running barefoot.  It&#39;s in this section that &lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/&quot;&gt;Barefoot Ken Bob Saxton&lt;/a&gt; and I, the only completely barefoot runners in the whole article, are quoted. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then the article moves onto quoting Dr Reed Ferber of the Running Injury Clinic at the University of Calgary:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see so many patients book appointments on Mondays because they took a weekend camp to do barefoot running and literally ran a few hundred kilometres with no shoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Surely this can&#39;t be true or accurate.  I think Dr Ferber may have been seriously misquoted, quoted out of context or he&#39;s really anti-barefoot running. If it is true and these camps exist, then someone needs to be shot.  Either the people running the camps who are trying to make a quick buck without actually thinking, or those who are attending these camps thinking they&#39;ll emerge injury free barefoot runners in two short days. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;No matter how good a runner you are in shoes, you&#39;re can&#39;t expect to continue at the same rate when you kick off your shoes.  Your feet will be weak and unconditioned after years of being shielded by the shoes you&#39;ve been running in.  You wouldn&#39;t take a fat couch potato and make him run the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nycmarathon.org/&quot;&gt;New York City Marathon&lt;/a&gt;, swim the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midmarmile.co.za/&quot;&gt;MidMar Mile&lt;/a&gt; (the worlds largest open water race) or cycle the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.letour.fr/&quot;&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; without any training and adaptation - why would you do the equivalent with barefoot running?  Thankfully the article does cover this angle later on with several excerpts from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildfitness.com/special/lee_saxby.htm&quot;&gt;Lee Saxby&lt;/a&gt;, a barefoot running and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.posetech.com/&quot;&gt;POSE method&lt;/a&gt; coach, who emphasises that barefoot running requires a period of transition, and I couldn&#39;t agree more.  On a side note, I missed an opportunity to meet Lee at the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/evo-p-1263.html&quot;&gt;VivoBarefoot Evo&lt;/a&gt; (review coming soon) kick-off breakfast run in London due to commitments relating to the recent death of my daughter. Maybe I&#39;ll get the opportunity another day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The article finishes off with the general summary that barefoot running should only really be used as a tool in your training toolbox, that it&#39;s not some magic miracle cure and that it shouldn&#39;t be a lifestyle choice.  I agree mostly with this, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t suggest ruling it out as a &quot;lifestyle choice&quot;.  I think this is something everyone should assess for themselves.  I&#39;ve chosen this route, but it doesn&#39;t mean you have to.  The only way you&#39;ll be able to tell if this is really something you want to do long term or if it&#39;ll have any effect in preventing your common running injuries is to actually get out there and do it consistently - take a whole season to give it a proper go as one or two runs a week on grass won&#39;t really give you a good idea.  Of course, if barefoot running isn&#39;t for you, then by all means carry on running in shoes, but do make sure you bung in a couple of runs barefoot if you can - barefoot running on golf courses is glorious.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and I wouldn&#39;t waste my time with the strengthening exercise detailed on the last page. I don&#39;t think these will prepare you for the rigours of barefoot running.  The only way you&#39;ll be able to strengthen you calves, feet and stabilising muscles for barefoot running is by running barefoot.  The exercises listed are just not specific enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So in summary, I think the article is good in that is brings a bit of attention to barefoot running in a mainstream magazine and it may be just enough to persuade a couple more people to give it a go, but sadly it&#39;s a little biased against taking it up whole-hog.  This isn&#39;t surprising considering most of the money made from Runner&#39;s World comes from advertising, in particular shoe advertising, so they won&#39;t want to be seen to shoot themselves in the foot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have a read of the article and make up your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Trying Out dailymile</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/trying-out-dailymile\"/>\n   <updated>2010-03-24T18:29:17+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/trying-out-dailymile</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;dailymile_badge_143x56_grey.png&quot; src=&quot;/assets/dailymile_badge_143x56_grey.png&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; width=&quot;143&quot; height=&quot;56&quot; /&gt;I&#39;ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/&quot;&gt;Fetcheveryone&lt;/a&gt; to log all my running since July 2009 and overall I&#39;m quite pleased with it. I recently discovered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymile.com/&quot;&gt;dailymile&lt;/a&gt; and it certainly looks very pretty (lots of Web2.0rhea) but I&#39;m not convinced by the whole idea of &quot;social training&quot; or whatever they want to call it nor dailymile&#39;s overall functionality and behaviour. It seems lacking and buggy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;When developing the the &quot;Latest Training&quot; section in my sidebar, I went hunting for some other site that offers some sort of official widget or gadget to display recent training etc in my site&#39;s sidebar.  This is how I stumbled upon dailymile.  It&#39;s got a few interesting widgets so I signed up and hit my first hurdle - no Garmin import support.  I quite like and now rely on the import functionality Fetcheveryone has and I now deem it an essential. Accordingly, I put things on hold and didn&#39;t even bother trying to use dailymile.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This week I discovered dailymile have finally introduced Garmin import support (beta still): it imports it from the incredibly useless &lt;a href=&quot;http://connect.garmin.com/&quot;&gt;Garmin Connect&lt;/a&gt;.  With this news, I imported all my training from Garmin.  So far so good.  It seemed to work quite well, though it didn&#39;t import any of the limited notes I put up on Garmin Connect. It seems to have just imported the raw GPS data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, with my runs imported I manually set to updating each one and copying my notes across from Fetcheveryone into each run. I then manually entered all this year&#39;s runs from Fetcheveryone.  It was during all this laborious work that I realised I don&#39;t think dailymile is for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My current annoyances are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can&#39;t independently import routes from anywhere - not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mapmyrun.com/&quot;&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt;, not Fetcheveryone, not from a GPX or TPX file or even directly from your Garmin device unless it&#39;s part of importing a run.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What routes you do have, you can&#39;t completely hide.  They&#39;re either viewable by everyone or just your friends.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can&#39;t import previous training data from any external source, not even a simple CSV file - this leads to the ball-arch that is manually importing all your data.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can&#39;t export any of your training, in case you want to switch to somewhere else, or even just so you can perform you own local analysis.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The website is trying to live up to the hype that is Web 2.0, but sadly this doesn&#39;t always work. The javascript that powers most of the site stops responding so you have to refresh the page to give it a kick.  This happens on Safari, Firefox and Chrome, all on a Mac.  I&#39;ve not tested on other operating systems, but I doubt it&#39;ll be any better.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can&#39;t edit your &quot;gear&quot; entries, or if you can, it&#39;s certainly not intuitive and I didn&#39;t find out how short of adding a new item and removing the old.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The preferences and settings are not all centralised in one place. You have to hunt around for the various settings.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not all bad.  I quite like the idea of their widgets, the fact the site isn&#39;t smothered in advertising and it&#39;s fresh modern look, though it could do with looking a lot less like Facebook in places, but that&#39;s about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My only issues, and these are really just niggles, with Fetcheveryone are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s not the prettiest of sites&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the &quot;Barefoot&quot; shoe type doesn&#39;t show up in the sidebar (I like to be able to quickly glance and see how much of my running has been barefoot)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; and there are no widgets for easy sharing of data onto any other site, though they do offer several methods to export different data.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise everything it intuitive and seems to just work and work well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not going to stop using dailymile just yet. I&#39;ll keep entering data on it for a while longer to see if it grows on me and to see if the issues I&#39;ve highlighted are resolved anytime soon (I&#39;m not holding my breath though as the Garmin import support took forever to arrive, despite being advertised as &quot;coming soon&quot; since dailymile&#39;s inception). Time will tell. Until then, I think I&#39;ll keep hacking away at my own &quot;widgets&quot; for Fetcheveryone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over all I think dailymile is aimed more at the Facebook/Twitter addicted fun runners who want to natter than those who want a highly functional and detailed online location to store their training runs.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Siraj Gena Wins Rome Marathon BAREFOOT</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/siraj-gena-wins-rome-marathon-barefoot\"/>\n   <updated>2010-03-21T17:53:48+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/siraj-gena-wins-rome-marathon-barefoot</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Seeing is believing...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Siraj Gena finishing the 2010 Rome Marathon barefoot&quot; src=&quot;/assets/SirajGena-RomeMarathon-2010.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;594&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, almost.

It&#39;s dry and sunny with a slight cool breeze blowing.  I&#39;d planned on going for a long run later today once the roads had warmed up a bit, but when I saw how gorgeous it was outside, I couldn&#39;t hold myself back and headed out a little earlier than planned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What a fantastic run.  I&#39;d originally planned on only running about 8km, but before I knew it I&#39;d already clocked up 6km and was about 4km from home.  I could probably have carried on further, but given 8km was my previous longest barefoot run, I thought it best to head back home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I got home, I sync&#39;d up my Garmin Forerunner 405CX (note to self, I really should write about my new toy some time) with Garmin Connect (leaves a lot to be desired, but it happens automatically) and my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/userprofile.php?id=32814&amp;show=training&quot;&gt;FetchEveryone&lt;/a&gt; account.  Whilst checking my log on FetchEveryone I noticed I&#39;d managed to tick off two of my goals this week:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;20km per week in training completely barefoot&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;10km long training run&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m quite chuffed with this and believe it&#39;s all down to switching to ONLY running barefoot since the beginning of February.  This has definitely allowed me to run further and with more ease than when switching between Vibrams and barefoot. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, on a side note: if you want to check your barefoot form, head down to &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Thames+Valley+Park&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=23.701453,45.131836&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Thames+Valley+Park&amp;hnear=Thames+Valley+Park&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A&quot;&gt;Thames Valley Park&lt;/a&gt;.  The grassy bit along the Thames where they do the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/Home.aspx&quot;&gt;Reading Park Run&lt;/a&gt; (on my todo list) is very wet and soggy in places.  You&#39;ll very easily be able to tell if your pushing off or landing incorrectly as your feet slip and slosh through all the mud &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .  On the plus side, I think it&#39;s quite a magical feeling feeling the mud squelch between my toes.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">I&#39;m Back Online</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/back-online\"/>\n   <updated>2010-02-28T16:05:55+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/back-online</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Well folks, I&#39;m back online and trying to get back into the groove again. I technically wasn&#39;t completely offline, just lacking the motivation to write or get involved due to recent events on the home front.  Sadly, February has been a very tough month for my wife and I: our baby daughter, Lara, unfortunately didn&#39;t make it through the open heart surgery she had to undergo in order to rectify two congenital heart defects.  I&#39;m not going to go into the details here but if you&#39;re interested, I will be posting a series of posts, building up to my daughter&#39;s funeral on 12 March, on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.co.uk/&quot;&gt;main site&lt;/a&gt;. Suffice to say we were devastated and completely knocked for six by this, even though we&#39;d known about the heart condition before she was born.  The loss of a child is something you really can&#39;t prepare yourself for no matter how much forewarning you received.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;I&#39;ve now had several weeks to grieve and I think I&#39;m starting to come to terms with it all and am getting my motivation back.  I&#39;m back into the office tomorrow so we&#39;ll see how I get on.  On the plus side, I have still been running - it&#39;s a brilliant tool for coping with stress, anger, sadness and the loss of a loved one - and completely barefoot too.   Yes, EVERY ONE of the 41.45 kilometers run this month have been completely barefoot and I&#39;ve loved it.  My feet are toughening up beautifully and I&#39;m sure every run is getting easier and more comfortable.  That said I do sometimes doubt it when heading out in the cold and wet: these are still the toughies which tend to result in a blister or two on a few of my toes but they&#39;re very quickly outweighed by the ease and comfort of the dry warmer runs.  I&#39;m really looking forward to summer when all my runs will be in the warm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; alt=&quot;Terra Plana EVO&quot; src=&quot;/assets/evo.jpg&quot; /&gt;The last week has also been quite an eventful one in the barefoot running world thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com&quot;&gt;Terra Plana&lt;/a&gt;. They&#39;ve just released the first ever barefoot running shoe, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/the-evo&quot;&gt;VivoBarefoot EVO&lt;/a&gt; (remember all the other minimalist shoes we use weren&#39;t originally designed with barefoot running in mind).  I gave everyone a &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/vivobarefoot-evo-running-shoes-sneak-peak&quot;&gt;sneak peak&lt;/a&gt; before and now they&#39;re finally available to buy.  I&#39;ve not put in my order yet as I&#39;m still debating with myself as to if I buy another pair of Vibrams (I really like my Classics), get my grubby paws on a pair of these bad boys or skip the shoes completely.  Initial reviews of the EVOs (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hhollines.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Harry here&lt;/a&gt; is giddy with excitement about the EVOs &lt;a href=&quot;http://hhollines.blogspot.com/2010/02/im-wearing-my-evos.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://hhollines.blogspot.com/2010/02/thank-you-evo.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hhollines.blogspot.com/2010/02/evo-review-longhard-run.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) have been very positive and it sounds like Terra Plana may have just hit the nail on the head with the EVOs and at the same time being the first to market in what could potentially be a very lucrative niche.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Terra Plana do however have one potential thorn in their side with the EVOs - the price.  Whilst £100 is quite reasonable and competitive in the UK where a pair of Vibram FiveFinger Classics cost about £90; $160 is just extortionate in the US where a pair of Classics cost about $75 (ignoring discounts and voucher codes).  That said, it&#39;s quite refreshing to see product prices vaguely taking into account the exchange rates. So often we see products sold for $100 in the US and then sold for £100 in the UK.  Anyway, time will tell how successful Terra Plana are in coaxing people away from highly cushioned and supportive Nike/Adidas/Asics/Brooks/whatever shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve shelled out for the EVOs, I&#39;d be happy to hear how you find them.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">My Thoughts on The Lieberman Paper</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/my-thoughts-on-the-lieberman-paper\"/>\n   <updated>2010-02-02T12:34:12+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/my-thoughts-on-the-lieberman-paper</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; alt=&quot;The cover of the &#39;Nature&#39; journal for Jan 2010&quot; src=&quot;/assets/NatureCoverJan2010.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;198&quot; /&gt;I&#39;ve finally managed to get my hands on The Lieberman &quot;letter&quot;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7280/full/nature08723.html&quot;&gt;Foot strike patterns and collision forces in habitually barefoot versus shod runners&lt;/a&gt; reported in January&#39;s edition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; and I&#39;ve read through it, the accompanying &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunning.fas.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Harvard site&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of the reviews other people have made, and here are my observations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I believe this paper has been over-hyped and misinterpreted (possibly deliberately as it makes &quot;good news&quot;) in a big way.  I think the main reason for this is it&#39;s the first major research paper in years that actually involves comparisons between barefoot and shod runners.  There have been other recent studies that have documented the merits of different foot strikes (fore/mid/heel), but none have made the comparison between barefoot and shod runners.  There&#39;s also the added attention barefoot running is currently enjoying thanks to Christopher McDougall&#39;s book: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1861978235/?tag=costest-21&quot;&gt;Born to Run&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/book-born-to-run-by-christopher-mcdougall&quot;&gt;my review&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;The paper itself doesn&#39;t provide anything particularly new, at least for someone who has already made the transition from running in shoes to barefoot, or who has watched the running style and landing of runners of varying degrees of age, speed and profession.  What is does do is officially put some science behind the anecdotal evidence many barefoot runners talk about with regards to impact and foot strike when running barefoot.  This is the &quot;&lt;em&gt;I told you so&lt;/em&gt;&quot; part I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/ive-not-missed-the-lieberman-paper&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think most people and the media are reading a lot more into this paper than the authors are actually stating and not actually reading what&#39;s right in front of them.  Essentially, the paper is only documenting and comparing their observations on...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;foot strike patterns in shod and barefoot Americans and Kenyans (groups 1-5)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;and collision forces in shod and barefoot Americans (groups 1 and 3)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... who have been habitually barefoot or shod.  Nothing more. It&#39;s there in the title: &quot;&lt;em&gt;Foot strike patterns and collision forces in habitually barefoot versus shod runners&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. All corresponding hypotheses about reducing injuries are exactly that - hypotheses.  There is no research (yet) indicating that running barefoot reduces impact related injuries or running in shoes causes injuries.  It only suggests there &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be a correlation and this is the part that I feel the media and most people have hooked onto.  &quot;May&quot; is being treated like &quot;Will&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The authors didn&#39;t really help prevent this by finishing off the paper with...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence that barefoot and minimally shod runners avoid RFS strikes with high-impact collisions may have public health implications. The average runner strikes the ground 600 times per kilometre, making runners prone to repetitive stress injuries. The incidence of such injuries has remained considerable for 30 years despite technological advancements that provide more cushioning and motion control in shoes designed for heel–toe running. Although cushioned, high-heeled running shoes are comfortable, they limit proprioception and make it easier for runners to land on their heels. Furthermore, many running shoes have arch supports and stiffened soles that may lead to weaker foot muscles, reducing arch strength. This weakness contributes to excessive pronation and places greater demands on the plantar fascia, which may cause plantar fasciitis. Although there are anecdotal reports of reduced injuries in barefoot populations, controlled prospective studies are needed to test the hypothesis that individuals who do not predominantly RFS either barefoot or in minimal footwear, as the foot apparently evolved to do, have reduced injury rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this is a bit of a sensational closing paragraph which has just the right ring to it to catch the media&#39;s attention with the last sentence being ignored in most reports I&#39;ve seen.  Thankfully, the authors have acknowledged that their paper has been misinterpreted by the media on the first page of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunning.fas.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;supporting website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The supporting &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunning.fas.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; itself covers the much broader topic of barefoot running and it&#39;s merits.  It draws on and references material from this and other studies to help put together a good single resource for people curious in the merits of running barefoot.  It does emphasis in several places that this is really only for informational purposes and does not constitute a definitive statement on the best way to run or the effects on injury.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So whilst this paper doesn&#39;t actually document anything new, I feel it will start the ball rolling on more controversial and potentially sensational research.  I think this study it just the stepping stone needed for others to actually research the effects of running in shoes vs running barefoot with respect to injuries and performance.  I do have one slight reservation with stating this though: in this litigious world, would the running shoe manufacturers actually allow such research to see the light of day if it proves shoes are causing more harm than not?&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">I&#39;ve Not Missed the Lieberman Paper</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/ive-not-missed-the-lieberman-paper\"/>\n   <updated>2010-01-29T20:39:41+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/ive-not-missed-the-lieberman-paper</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note to say, no, I&#39;ve not been sleeping under a rock (sleep, what&#39;s that?).

Whilst timid, these guys shouldn&#39;t be snubbed as they tend to hear you long before you see them and they&#39;re long gone by the time you get within smelling distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Previously when running in shoes, I might catch a glimpse of a one of these animals in the distance and then watch then run off. Now, when running barefoot or in my Vibrams, I find I can get very close before they hear me and get a good look before they dash off.  Sometimes the animal doesn&#39;t even dash off, but instead stops and watches me like I&#39;m the wild animal - this has happened on numerous occasions with deer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&#39;s now quite common for me to get within a few meters of a squirrels before they hear me, and even then they don&#39;t bolt like they used to.  Most of them move slightly out of my way and then turn and watch my feet just like humans do, and probably with the same thought crossing their mind - Crazy fool!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy the encounters I now make with the best of Britain&#39;s wildlife, and it&#39;s all thanks to getting rid of the shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">What To Wear When You Run</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/what-to-wear-when-you-run\"/>\n   <updated>2010-01-03T13:10:58+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/what-to-wear-when-you-run</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;What Should I wear?&quot; src=&quot;/assets/whattowear.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If &quot;&lt;em&gt;run regularly&lt;/em&gt;&quot; is on your tentative list of New Year&#39;s resolutions, you may find Runner&#39;s World&#39;s (US) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.com/cda/whattowear/0,7152,s6-240-325-330-0-0-0-0,00.html&quot;&gt;What Should I Wear?&lt;/a&gt; calculator may help you pick appropriate attire.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just bung in the temperature, wind speed, and sky conditions, then add how you prefer to feel when you run (cool, in-between, warm) and it&#39;ll suggest what you should wear.

Well in retrospect, I don&#39;t think it was a stress fracture at all, rather I believe it was just the muscles and tendons in my feet telling me that I was taking things too fast too soon.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The break from running helped my feet recuperate and allow me to drop a few pounds too.  I was soon however &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/back-on-my-feet&quot;&gt;back on my feet&lt;/a&gt; in mid-February and rearing to go.  I was soon running with a certain degree of regularity in my Vibrams and enjoying it as I slowly increased my fitness and distance.  Nothing too crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then it came - my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-completely-barefoot-run&quot;&gt;first completely barefoot run&lt;/a&gt; in April.  WOW!!! I loved it and was hooked on the feeling of running completely barefoot.  However that wasn&#39;t enough to stop me from trying one more run in shoes.  Bad idea.  It hurt and on 28 May 2009, I drew a line in the sand and stated &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/no-more-shoes&quot;&gt;I would not run in shoes again&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following my declaration, I enjoyed a fabulous &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/two-weeks-of-barefoot-bliss&quot;&gt;shoe-free summer holiday&lt;/a&gt;, switched to a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/review-vivobarefoot-aqua-by-terra-plana&quot;&gt;Vivo Barefoot Aquas&lt;/a&gt; for my general purpose casual shoes, slowly built up my mileage and the strength in my feet and ticked off the first 5 of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals&quot;&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt; as I went along.  I also started recording my runs on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/userprofile.php?id=32814&quot;&gt;FetchEveryone.com&lt;/a&gt; and created a little feed in the sidebar to show off my training and keep me motivated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The year has ended with a bit of a slow down in my running: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/no-more-barefoot-for-this-year&quot;&gt;cold soon ruled out any further barefoot runs&lt;/a&gt; for the year before the wet, snow and holidays all set in to put a further spanner in the works.  I&#39;m not really too concerned about this as everyone needs a break and Christmas time is as good a time as any to take one.  It also helps with the motivation needed for the new year&#39;s resolutions, which brings me nicely onto what I have planned for next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next year is going to start off a bit bumpy: my wife and I are due our first little one in January so when I&#39;m not looking after the baby, the wife or work, I&#39;ll probably be sleeping. I hope to squeeze in some runs where ever possible.  Once things settle down on the home front I&#39;ll start work on attaining some of my goals with the primary goal of completing at least one 10km race completely barefoot and a tentative goal of running a half-marathon in Vibrams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This may not seem like much, but if I manage to achieve both goals, I&#39;ll tick 6, possibly 7, other intermediate goals off my current list and may finish off the year as a regular barefoot runner.  Time will tell, but I&#39;ll certainly keep everyone updated as I progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll finish off by wishing everyone a fabulous new year and I hope you all set yourselves some realistic and achievable goals for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Merry Christmas 2009</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/merry-christmas-2009\"/>\n   <updated>2009-12-25T07:00:00+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/merry-christmas-2009</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Merry Christmas 2009&quot; src=&quot;/assets/MerryChristmas2009-red.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas everyone.

Winter has finally set in and it&#39;s blarrrrry cold outside.  Whilst we in the UK don&#39;t get the extreme cold and snow some other countries get, we do get a lot of rain which doesn&#39;t play well with the freezing cold on bare feet. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now I must say, I&#39;m not wussing out here, it&#39;s all for my own good.  Very cold numb feet just don&#39;t feel the ground anywhere near as well as warmer feet do.  As a result form is likely to go to pot and I&#39;m then likely to rip my feet to shreds without even realising it.   It was quite cold and wet on my last completely barefoot run and my feet took about 15 mins to warm up completely.   It&#39;s much colder now so I don&#39;t expect my feet to warm up at all during a run, unless it&#39;s a very very long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All is not lost though: I&#39;m not giving up minimalist running.

I&#39;ve now found another &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefoot-running.com/blog/?p=85&quot;&gt;useful tip&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how should they fit? I was told directly (in person) by a Vibram Five Fingers corporate rep to fit the toes just BEHIND THE TOE CAPS or right in that area—obviously with different toe lengths there is going to be some fudging here!  That means there is a decent amount of room between the toes and the end (close to 1/2″) and there may be some bagginess in places depending on your foot volume.  Keep in mind that your foot will swell while you are running so any snugness you feel in the store should be a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course this tip is only useful if you can find a shop that sells Vibrams before you shell out your cash or you have them in your hand.

I saw this guy through the trees catching up to me pretty quick running. I was taking a nice leisurely pace as my feet were sorta sore from 12 miles of walking on concrete and gravel and blacktop yesterday. Once he swings around onto the path I&#39;m on I hear his pace slow up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He comes up next to me &quot;&lt;em&gt;how ya doin?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; he asks. &quot;&lt;em&gt;doing good&lt;/em&gt;&quot; I say and smile politely.&lt;br /&gt;\n&quot;&lt;em&gt;mind if I ask you a question?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; he asks, &quot;&lt;em&gt;sure...&lt;/em&gt;&quot; I glance down at his shoes. &quot;&lt;em&gt;wait, how come you&#39;re wearing shoes!?!?&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He gave me a look like &#39;OK...&#39;&lt;br /&gt;\n&quot;&lt;em&gt;no for real&lt;/em&gt;&quot; I continue &quot;&lt;em&gt;how come you&#39;re wearing shoes?&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n&quot;&lt;em&gt;because....

I found I was often too busy or couldn&#39;t be bothered to go to the gym twice a week, and I&#39;ve been adding a lot more running into the mix instead of being a slave to the cardio equipment in the gym.  I have however stuck to the weights part quite well, except for dropping the lunges every now and then as they were having too much of an impact on my running on the first few days that followed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This new program is once again, deemed as a guide for myself, but this time with a concentration on strength.  I don&#39;t want to bulk up too much, but I do want to increase my strength as this will definitely help with the running and when combined with a bit of plyometrics should help me &quot;float&quot; a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;So my plan is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout 1: Chest &amp; Back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Incline Flyes (pre-exhaust)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 1-3 Incline Dumbell Presses&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Straight Arm Lat Pull Downs (pre-exhaust)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Reverse Grip Lat Pull Downs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Deadlifts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout 2: Legs &amp; Abs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 12-20 Leg Extensions (pre-exhaust)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 12-20 Leg Press&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 12-20 Standing Calf Raises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 12-20 Situps&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout 3: Shoulders &amp; Arms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Dumbbell Lat Raises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Bent Over Dumbbell Lat Raises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Reverse Grip Pulldowns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Tricep Pressdowns (pre-exhaust)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 3-5 Dips&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now this needs some notes to explain my intentions...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Each rep is performed in a controlled manner over the full range of motion.  No jerking, yanking or using momentum.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Each set is only done to momentary failure.  No more. No less.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Each weight is picked to try and ensure I reach the point of momentary failure within the specified range. If the weight it too light, I&#39;ll keep going until I reach momentary failure and increase the weight next time.  If too heavy, lower the weight next time, unless I fall within the specified range.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some of the complex movements are preceded by pre-exhaustion exercises.  This is to try and work as many muscles in as little time as possible, without over-exhausting any of the smaller ones.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When a pre-exhaustion exercise is used, there is no rest between the end of it, and the following exercise.  All other rests are &quot;&lt;em&gt;until I feel ready for the next exercise&lt;/em&gt;&quot; length rests, but no more than 5 mins.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Each workout will occur every 4 to 7 days.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If I&#39;m feeling creative, I may bung in some running specific plyometric exercises between sets too.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This should keep all workouts quite short and sweet and I should feel good, maybe even exhilarated, after with the feeling that I could do more.  The idea is not to tire myself out, just stress the muscles into adapting by increasing strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&#39;ll then be running on the other days of the week.  I&#39;m still experimenting with that I&#39;ll do on the running days, but will aim to put some sort of structure in place on that side of things soon. &lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Review: VivoBarefoot Aqua By Terra Plana</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/review-vivobarefoot-aqua-by-terra-plana\"/>\n   <updated>2009-10-26T11:04:52+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/review-vivobarefoot-aqua-by-terra-plana</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Aqua&quot; src=&quot;/assets/691987053_Lkjpf-200x210.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;210&quot; /&gt;In my quest to go completely barefoot, or as near as possible in as many environments as possible, I&#39;ve had my eye on replacing all my chunky shoes with more minimalist shoes. I&#39;ve had my eyes on a couple of brands, including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/vivobarefoot.php&quot;&gt;VivoBarefoot&lt;/a&gt; range from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com&quot;&gt;Terra Plana&lt;/a&gt;, but haven&#39;t really seen any in person to get an idea of what they&#39;re like.  I also wasn&#39;t too keen on blindly shelling out for a pair of shoes I&#39;d seen on the internet, have them imported from the US only to find they&#39;re hideous in person.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, luck was on my side as I was approached by a kind lady on behalf of Terra Plana and given the opportunity try a pair of shoes from their VivoBarefoot range.  After much umming and ahhing - &quot;Do I go for the casual looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/aqua-p-1040.html&quot;&gt;Aquas&lt;/a&gt; for everyday use, or the more formal looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/dharma-p-1036.html?colour=143&quot;&gt;Dharmas&lt;/a&gt; for work use?&quot; - I opted for the Aquas, in white  (other colours are available), and placed my order.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Box&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later, a great big box arrived in the post.  I was only expecting a shoe-box sized box, but this was double the size.  I soon found out why... there were two pairs in the box: one in the size I&#39;d ordered (UK 10 / EU 44)  and one in the next size up (UK 11 / EU 45).  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those who like to see what comes in the box, here&#39;s a picture...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/691986894_eY5tE-500x500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Contents of a Terra Plana Aqua shoe box&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oooooo, aaaaaah &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;  For the greens out there - it&#39;s all recyclable too and actually encourages it on the back of the box...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/691986692_NwH9g-500x500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;We at Terra Plana hope that you will reuse this box. Here are five ideas: 1. Store your undies in it.&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Use it as a durable yet elegant gift box. 3. Bury your dead pet hamster in it. 4. Create a window box and grow mustard, cress and alfalfa sprouts. 5. Get snap happy and make a pinhole camera with it. To get more boxes to be re-used, order another pair of Terra Plana shoes at www.terraplana.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s at this point that I must point out that Terra Plana is probably the greenest shoe company on the planet, within their control&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/ethical_policy.php&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;.  Not only do they regularly re-evaluate what they can do to minimize waste and toxin use in their products, they try their hardest to make sure they use recycled materials and even make the box they sell the shoes in fully recyclable. Now how&#39;s that for green.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Fit&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Time for my fitting.  I have a very &quot;rigorous&quot; sizing test: I put them on, and then wonder around the house or sit in front of the computer until either it hurts, or I remember I need to try the other size.  First off the 10s: they fitted and were quite snug and comfy.  After about an hour I remembered I was testing the sizes and switched to the 11s.  What a difference. The 11s definitely felt bigger though I wasn&#39;t too sure if maybe they were a little too big.  No time for deliberating; this is a scientific test, so let the shoes speak for themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I soon completely forgot about the 11s on my feet.  They felt very comfortable, but I wasn&#39;t going to rule the 10s out just yet.  Time for a bit of side-by-side comparison: size 10 on one foot and size 11 on the other, and then switch. This final test was the clincher - definitely the 11s.  As I&#39;ve since read elsewhere, the VivoBarefoot shoes size a little on the small side and my experience confirms this.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Construction&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, Terra Plana are devoted to making sustainable and eco-friendly shoes, and we can see this in the construction of the Aquas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The VivoBarefoot Aquas are essentially made up of 3 parts:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The upper: this is a combination of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eleatherltd.com/&quot;&gt;E-Leather&lt;/a&gt; - a 75-80% recycled leather and synthetic fibre combination that looks and feels like real leather - and a synthetic mesh-like fabric made from recycled &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate&quot;&gt;polyethylene terephthalate&lt;/a&gt; (aka PET) panels.  This combination gives an attractive, light and flexible upper.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you recognise the acronym PET, that&#39;s because it&#39;s what coke bottles are made from.  It&#39;s also the stuff that is recycled to make fleeces, and now the fabric in the Aquas.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The inner: this is made up of several parts too.  The inner as a whole is soft with a little bit of cushioning around the entrance of the shoe with a sock-like inner liner that is the length of the tongue.  There is also a very thin foam removable inner sole.  As with the upper, the inner is made from recycled materials.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The sole: this is an &quot;&lt;em&gt;ultra-high abrasion and puncture resistant sole&lt;/em&gt;&quot; which is incredibly thin (3mm) and very flexible. Unfortunately, this part isn&#39;t made form recycled materials, but it is stitched onto the upper rather than being glued, so all is not lost on the green credentials here.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over-all the construction is very good and well thought out. Time will tell how durable they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Comfort&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been a big fan of Merrell shoes for years - so much so I bought the same model and colour 3 times in a row.  I found them incredibly comfortable and hard wearing.  Sadly, these guys now pale in comparison to the VivoBarefoot Aquas: these shoes are singularly the most comfortable shoes I&#39;ve ever worn.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The sock-like liner hugs the shoe onto the foot very comfortably so technically you don&#39;t need to fasten the laces to hold the shoe on, though tightening the laces does secure the shoe better. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The lack of heel, took a little getting used to at first.  When I first tried on the Aquas, I&#39;d just taken off my work shoes - a smart pair of black leather shoes - and instantly noticed the lack of a heel.  It felt like the front of my foot was raised higher than the heel, but this soon faded.  One significant thing I found with extended wear and time on my feet in the Aquas: I didn&#39;t experience the lower back pain I sometimes got when wearing the Merrells for extended periods of time.  This could be co-incidence, but I&#39;m inclined to believe it&#39;s the lack of heel, which in turn has resulted in an unnoticeable and slight improvement in posture as detailed in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/vivobarefoot_benefits.php&quot;&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; described by Terra Plana themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The thin soles and thin inner-sole really allow you to feel the ground below your feet too, and whilst you don&#39;t get as much feedback as you do from Vibram Five Fingers, you still get plenty.  The slight cushioning also makes heel striking, that is common with walking, a lot more comfortable and tolerable too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Look&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think everyone will like the look of the VivoBarefoot Aquas (my borther-in-law doesn&#39;t). They are quite a low profiled and wide shoe, but unlike the tyres on sports cars, society seems to think low profile (and minimalist when not slip-slops) shoes look weird.  The toe box is also wider than normal shoes, and whilst it&#39;s very comfortable, some people will associate the wider toe box with lower intelligence, a lack of class and even clowns (people come up with the strangest excuses).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I personally think the Aquas look great, and I really like the white ones.  I&#39;m not concerned with what people think of my shoes, or lack there of.  I&#39;m comfortable in the knowledge that I&#39;m doing the world of good for my body, and that&#39;s all that counts - I also had disproportionately large feet as a child so I soon learnt to ignore any comments about my feet. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The only downside I&#39;ve found with the Aquas is all my jeans are now too long.  I never realised just how much the heels on my Merrells were keeping my jeans off the floor, until I switched to the Aquas and found myself treading on the back of my trousers all the time.  To resolve this, I&#39;m bringing back the rolled up jeans look.  Watch out: it&#39;ll be all over the catwalks before you know it &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/691987244_fmbPV-200x133.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Aqua - Front&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/691987422_uGwZj-200x134.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Aqua - Side&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Summary&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have to admit I am very very impressed with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/aqua-p-1040.html&quot;&gt;VivoBarefoot Aquas&lt;/a&gt;.  They are incredibly comfortable, light, attractive, and even in the short period of time owning them, I&#39;m already noticing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/vivobarefoot_benefits.php&quot;&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt;.  I think the best way I can summarise wearing the Aquas is it&#39;s like wearing your slippers everywhere, but without the fear of the men in white coats coming to take you to a comfortably padded room.  I used to take off my shoes the moment I walked in the door, I don&#39;t when wearing the Aquas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These are singularly the most comfortable shoes I&#39;ve ever worn, and I&#39;ll be wearing them at every appropriate opportunity that isn&#39;t already taken by wearing my Vibrams or no shoes at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve deliberately not mentioned running in these.  I wouldn&#39;t advocate it.  The Aquas are definitely a casual shoe, and whilst you probably could run in them, I suspect you may soon find they&#39;re not the best for running.  All is not lost though, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/&quot;&gt;Terra Plana&lt;/a&gt; are bringing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/vivobarefoot-evo-running-shoes-sneak-peak&quot;&gt;VivoBarefoot Evo&lt;/a&gt; early next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One final tip: if you&#39;re buying these online without trying them on first, order one size larger than you usually wear.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">20km Per Week Goal: Done!</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/20km-per-week-goal-done\"/>\n   <updated>2009-10-25T07:53:12+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/20km-per-week-goal-done</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;As suspected &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/10km-in-a-week-barefoot-goal-ticked-off&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, I didn&#39;t manage to get in the barefoot miles this week that I got in last week.  I did try once, but the route I took turned out to be a lot tougher on the feet than expected, especially the chestnut and other tree debris in the early and latter parts of the route.    The early morning cold doesn&#39;t make things any easier either, though my feet did warm up quite quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One plus side of last week is I felt fantastic after every run, so kept on running. As a result I quite happily ticked through 20km (over 22km in fact) without any complaints. Other than the 4.96km done barefoot, the rest were all done in my Vibrams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think next week I&#39;ll do a bit of out-and-back on the smoother sections of the routes round work to get more barefoot time in.  What will be interesting is seeing how I cope with the cold in the early mornings. The clocks have gone back today, so in theory it should be lighter and thus slightly warmer, though winter is fast approaching.  Who knows, I may have to move the barefoot runs to the afternoon.  We&#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">10km In a Week Barefoot Goal Ticked Off</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/10km-in-a-week-barefoot-goal-ticked-off\"/>\n   <updated>2009-10-16T16:36:49+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/10km-in-a-week-barefoot-goal-ticked-off</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, I&#39;m proud to say that today I ticked off the &quot;10km per week in training completely barefoot&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals&quot;&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; I set for myself, and I&#39;m quite proud of myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had a great week of barefoot running this thanks to some great autumnal weather and being on the early shift. Being on the early shift means I have to go for my runs later in the day, when it&#39;s warmer, from home rather than bright and early from work, when it&#39;s cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;On Monday, I set off on the out-and-back route I&#39;ve been using whenever I&#39;d been running barefoot before, but when I reached the turnaround point, I decided I wouldn&#39;t.  I decided to carry on all the way round the block (it&#39;s a 4.33km block) and I&#39;m glad I did.  The run was fantastic and my feet felt great.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then on Wednesday, I did the route in reverse.  Sadly, though I was a little over-eager and tried to go too fast.  As a result my form was a bit poor and I developed a few blisters on my toes which needed dealing with in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/dealing-with-blisters&quot;&gt;usual way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After Wednesday&#39;s exuberance, I&#39;d resigned to running today in my Vibrams, but when the time came to run I found that my blister-healing trick had worked brilliantly and my feet felt great.  So off I went and did the same course again, in the same direction as Monday, barefoot again.  And it was just a good as Monday&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, 3x 4.33km makes it a nice 12.99km in a week and I tick off one more goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll be able to do this sort of distance next week from work - some of the pavements round work are quite aggressive on the old feet, but we&#39;ll see.  I&#39;ll certainly get in at least 12km next week, though maybe not all barefoot.  The early morning cold is also likely to be a factor.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">VivoBarefoot Evo Running Shoes Sneak Peak</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vivobarefoot-evo-running-shoes-sneak-peak\"/>\n   <updated>2009-10-07T11:33:59+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vivobarefoot-evo-running-shoes-sneak-peak</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Looky looky what I received in my inbox from a kind lady at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/&quot;&gt;Terra Plana&lt;/a&gt; (click for full size):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/photos/673118551_wiPwS-X2-1.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/673118551_wiPwS-L-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo Press Release&quot; width=&quot;426&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;These look great and, whilst not as quirky or as outrageously different as the Vibram Five Fingers, I think the VVFs may be in for quite a challenge.

Just above it is a &quot;&lt;em&gt;rigid orthotic foundation that supports and protects your entire midfoot.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; which prevents &quot;&lt;em&gt;... over-stretching of the plantar ligaments across the base of the foot&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ... which in turn helps prevent &quot;&lt;em&gt;painful heel spurs and plantar fasciitis&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.  Erm, isn&#39;t the stretching part what feet are meant to do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Z-CoiL footwear is engineered specifically to relieve foot, leg and back pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Its patented, shock-absorbing design greatly reduces impact to the body and distributes pressure more evenly across the foot than conventional shoes do. And less impact means less pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... and puts more cash in our pockets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, these shoes &quot;protect&quot; you by encompassing your feet in rigid blocks that don&#39;t move and adjust as your feet really should and then provides a spring to compensate for the lack of natural shock absorption and propulsion your feet naturally provide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh and they come in a wide range of fashionable designs too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please please please people, don&#39;t waste your money on these other than to maybe keep them in a glass cabinet along with your other bizarre collectors items.

This got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The method they use to analyse the gait and thus the &quot;need&quot; for orthotics is by using the pressure plate system like the GaitScan system.  For those not familiar with this method of analysis; essentially they put a rather advanced pressure mat onto the floor and then have you run over it, barefoot, aiming to land your foot squarely on the mat.  You then turn around and come back again and land on the mat with the other foot.  You may be asked to perform this a couple of times. Once done, a fancy colourful series of images is then presented onto the computer screen from which the agent can then analyse your gait.  If you&#39;ve never seen or experienced this system in action, pop down to your local Sweatshop, they&#39;ll be more than pleased to put it into action (and then sell you a pair of shoes &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I&#39;ve been thinking about this method of gait &quot;analysis&quot; and I can&#39;t help but feel it&#39;s flawed in several significant ways which are never mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It only analyses one foot at a time.  Now whilst not a major issue, the fact that the foot plate is only big enough for one foot would mean people are more likely to adjust their stride and landing in order to ensure they land squarely on the mat.  What&#39;s more, people are likely to strike the ground with the foot landing on the mat harder than normal to ensure they really do hit it and they get a reading.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The test is always done indoors and in a relatively confined amount of space.  I can&#39;t comment on other people, but 10 - 20m of total distance is not enough for me to get into my full normal stride - the stride I&#39;m likely to be employing when I actually head out onto the road.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;And most importantly, you always perform the test barefoot.  It&#39;s essential the test is done barefoot so the computer can see how your foot is landing (assuming we ignore the above) and reacting and pushing off.  Now the problem with this comes in the fact that scientists have already proven that people run differently when wearing shoes, then when not.  A heel striker in shoes is not likely to be a heel striker barefoot.  The foot will also land more carefully when barefoot and the push-off won&#39;t be as hard.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not a doctor, and I admit I have experienced this method of gait analysis and bought a pair of shoes based off it&#39;s results in the past, but in retrospect I can&#39;t help feel it may be completely unnecessary (thankfully you don&#39;t have to pay for the analysis) and could potentially lead to more injuries as the analysis, in my eyes, is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So what&#39;s the alternative?  Well, barefoot or nearly barefoot running as nature intended all the time of course, but that&#39;s a very biased view.  If you really need to have gait analysis performed (I doubt you do unless you&#39;re a pro trying to eke out every bit of efficiency possible), then I believe the video method, on a treadmill, is a better system to use, though it too has it disadvantages, namely access and costs, and is likely to have it&#39;s own flaws too (I&#39;ve not been privileged enough to have one of these so I can&#39;t comment).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With what I know now about the benefits of running barefoot and the way the foot adjusts and strengthens to the new demands, I think people should toss the shoes for at least one session a week for a couple of months and then see if they really still need to get orthotics.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Tabata Time</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tabata-time\"/>\n   <updated>2009-09-09T10:05:08+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tabata-time</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m taking a bit of a break from running at the moment to let my lower legs repair and recover a bit.  I&#39;ve been going a bit &lt;abbr title=&quot;Yiddish for crazy&quot;&gt;mashuga&lt;/abbr&gt; recently and haven&#39;t really given my feet and legs a chance to recover properly.  As a result the little niggles one can expect from first starting running barefoot (or almost) are not clearing up completely between runs.  I don&#39;t want these to develop into full on injuries, so I&#39;m taking another enforced break from running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now I don&#39;t want to just stop exercising completely and sit on my arse, however I do still want to keep my cardio levels up and use this time to burn off as much fat as I can.  Moving to barefoot (or almost) has meant I&#39;ve had to keep my mileage quite low, so I don&#39;t really get a chance to burn much of my excess weight off.  I&#39;ve been putting in some time in the gym between runs, but it&#39;s not been enough - I&#39;ve noticed my weight creeping back up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m using this enforced break from running to try out this &quot;Tabata technique/protocol&quot; I&#39;ve read about in various places on the net.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;The Tabata protocol was devised by Dr. Izumi Tabata and his team at the National Institute of Fitness and Sports in Tokyo and is a 4 minute intense set made up of 8x 20 second maximum intensity intervals with 10 seconds rest between each interval.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started off with this and soon found just one 4 minute workout was no where near enough for me.  I hardly built up a sweat in those 4 minutes, so I&#39;ve extended it a bit further and devised the following training regime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; Do not jump straight into this workout.  This is what I do.  You may not be able to do this straight away, so start gently and slowly. You will hurt afterwards and I don&#39;t want to be responsible for hurting someone or for causing a heart attack.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;: 30 minute tabata rowing intervals comprised of:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 mins slow and very gentle rowing&lt;/em&gt; (this is my warm up too)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;4 min tabata set&lt;/em&gt; (20 sec as fast as possible, 10 sec slow or stopped, repeat x8)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repeat the above 6 mins 5 times making a total of 30 mins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cool down and stretch&lt;/em&gt; (I don&#39;t time this as some days I cooldown quicker than others)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;: Full body tabata gym workout comprised of:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warm up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;3 sets of hanging pullups&lt;/em&gt;. I use good controlled form here and do as many reps as I can per set. I stop when I can&#39;t get my chin over the bar anymore.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 sets of 4 min tabata clean and press&lt;/em&gt; (20 sec of reps, 10 sec stopped, repeat x8) with a 2 min rest between each set. I don&#39;t do the olympic bum-to-floor style, I just life the barbell to my shoulders and then press it over my head.  That&#39;s one rep.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 sets of 4 min tabata machine chest press&lt;/em&gt; (20 sec of reps, 10 sec stopped, repeat x8). I use a machine here to be safe.  My arms and chest may get very very tired and I really don&#39;t fancy dropping a weight onto my face or chest.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 sets of 4 min alternating lunges&lt;/em&gt; (20 sec of reps, 10 sec stopped, repeat x8).  I hold a dumbell in each hands for these.  I use lifting straps too as my grip would give long before I&#39;m finished each set.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cool down and stretch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;: Rest - I want to lose weight, not kill myself&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;: 30 mins tabata cycling intervals as per the rowing intervals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;: Repeat Tuesday&#39;s workout.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday &amp; Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;: Rest&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve managed one week so far and boy is it tough, but I feel fantastic afterwards.  Each session burns in the region of 500-800kcal, depending on how much effort I put in and the weights etc involved and takes about 35-40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With lack of running and my commitment to weightlifting over the years my weight has fluctuated from the rather lean 64kg I was when running as an 19 year to the mighty 98kg I weighed in the peak of my weightlifting phase. I now sit slightly towards the top end of this range at 89kg. I know I&#39;ll never get back to 64kg, and quite frankly really don&#39;t want to be that skinny again, but I do think I could get down to a more reasonable 75-85kg.   This enforced break, coupled with the fact I&#39;m not drinking much beer at the moment (my wife and I are expecting our first child, so I&#39;m being supportive by cutting back on the amount of beer I drink) and this pretty intense exercise regime, should help me towards that goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll keep you all updated.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Barefootrunner.co.uk: Code Update</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefootrunnercouk-code-update\"/>\n   <updated>2009-09-01T16:22:00+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefootrunnercouk-code-update</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note to say I&#39;ve just updated the backend code to this site.

Take note of his times: 9.58 sec and 19.19 sec respectively.  Notice something extra-ordinary?  His 200m is only a fraction more than double his 100m time.  I&#39;d say once he&#39;s going, he&#39;s pretty much going at a constant speed for at least 160m of his 200m (assuming it takes him 40m to get up to speed).  Imagine his times if he could take a running start to both races or even if he could keep this going for a full 400m.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, come to think of it, if we did a very crude and overly simplified calculation we can probably guess what he&#39;s capable of over 400m:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First some assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He starts all events at the same speed and takes 40m to reach top speed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He maintains a constant speed (neigh on impossible, but we&#39;re looking at an ideal situation) for 360m of his 400m race&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He only slows by 3 5 1/100ths of a second for every successive 100m&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This would give him a time of 38:41 sec.  He&#39;d smash Michael Johnson&#39;s  world record (43.18 sec) by nearly 5 seconds. He&#39;d beat it even if we assumed he&#39;d lose a whole second per 100m.  Now that&#39;s impressive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll be moving up to the 400m any time soon, nor do I think he&#39;d actually be able to attain such a time - he is a man after all, not a machine, but I&#39;m certainly looking forward to his future races.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">New VVF Alternative Coming From Terra Plana</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vvf-alternative-coming-from-terra-plana\"/>\n   <updated>2009-08-22T09:22:03+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vvf-alternative-coming-from-terra-plana</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Check out what&#39;s been spotted on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitpic.com/elqiu&quot;&gt;interweb&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;New Terra Plana minimalist shoes&quot; src=&quot;/assets/NewTerraPlana.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A new pair of minimalist shoes to compete with Vibram Five Fingers.

I tried my hardest NOT to wear any shoes whenever possible and succeeded. In fact, today is the first day in 16 days in which I&#39;ve had to put on a pair of shoes and socks (for work) and I must say I can&#39;t wait to get them off.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I spent most of the time barefoot whilst milling around the campsites and driving.  I wore my Vibrams when out and about sight seeing (because barefoot isn&#39;t always appropriate) and cycling and I wore my cheap aging flipflops when the grass outside the tent was wet - my wife would go nuts if I even contemplated walking into the tent with muddy or wet feet/Vibrams &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/photos/621132537_uf7fE-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/621132537_uf7fE-499x287.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hanging Above Lac d&#39;Annecy&quot; title=&quot;Hanging Above Lac d&#39;Annecy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/photos/621132508_Xcigo-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/621132508_Xcigo-Th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vibrams on hang glider launch ramp&quot; title=&quot;Vibrams on hang glider launch ramp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/photos/621133454_jjehG-XL-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/621133454_jjehG-Th-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Barefoot at Champagne Colin&quot; title=&quot;Barefoot at Champagne Colin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/photos/621127420_bqvrf-XL-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/621127420_bqvrf-Th-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vibrams at the port at Bout-du-Lac&quot; title=&quot;Vibrams at the port at Bout-du-Lac&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all it was fantastic, and great fun to see the looks on people&#39;s faces as I wondered around barefoot or in my Vibrams.

Not the normal shoe and sock rubbing against flesh type, but rather the flesh rubbing against tar/dirt type.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the moment, my current barefoot mileage is in the region of 10km a week, on paving/tar, broken up into 3 sessions of just over 3km each.  This is just long enough for me to enjoy the freedom of running barefoot and feel when I&#39;m doing things wrong.  This is also long enough to acclimatise my feet to the rougher compounds with only a minimal amount of damage on each run.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, sometimes I&#39;m a little over-eager or tired and I either run too far, too fast, or with appalling form (ie too much toeing-off) and as a result I end up with a blister on one of my toes - normally the one just next to the little toe for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my blister treatment follows, but first a warning:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;What you are about to read is not for the faint hearted or the overly protective or sensitive types who want to drench things in anti-bac spray and then wrap in cotton wool to keep them safe and sound.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re a barefoot runner, or interested in running barefoot (hence you&#39;re reading this) this isn&#39;t likely to be you, but it may just be your other half/mother/GP etc, so best not perform this in front of them or let them know about this.  I know my wife gets very squeamish so I have to do this when she&#39;s not about.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Right, now we&#39;ve got that out of the way, we can get down to the nitty gritty...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wash your foot with warm soapy water.  You don&#39;t need to get all fancy with soaks or anti-bacterial or antiseptic soaps, just good ol&#39; plain soap will do the trick&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hobble (you don&#39;t want to make your foot dirty) over to your wife&#39;s/mother&#39;s/grandma&#39;s/your sewing kit and take out a thin sewing needle&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sterilize the needle by either heating it up with a candle/lighter or dipping it in antiseptic liquid.  I don&#39;t worry too much about this and just hold the needle in my mouth whilst I perform the next step.  Sssh, don&#39;t tell my wife or my mum, they&#39;ll both have a heart-attack at my sterilization techniques&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cut a length of cotton - any colour will do, but some say white is best.  I quite like red &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;.  The length isn&#39;t too important either, it just needs to be long enough for a little bit of threading&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thread your now sterilized needle and arm yourself - we&#39;re going in...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Locate your blister and slide your threaded needle right through the length of it until it comes out the other side.  Be sure to leave the thread going through the blister with a length protruding on either side.  This will be the wick used to drain all the moisture out.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mop up any liquid that may have seeped out and gently press down on your blister to help drain it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Trim the length of thread, if you need to.  About 1cm either side of the blister should be plenty.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it.  You&#39;re done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things will be a little sensitive for the first few hours, but you&#39;ll soon forget about it. Within a couple of days, you should find your blister will have healed, without any loss of skin and the thread will have worked it&#39;s way out all by itself. You may even find you can run on it within 24 hours, so your training shouldn&#39;t be affected too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m really not sure where I first heard this, but ever since trying it many many years ago as a kid, I&#39;ve stuck with it.  I don&#39;t know of a more effective and quicker treatment for blisters.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Athletic Footwear and Running Injuries</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/athletic-footwear-and-running-injuries-1\"/>\n   <updated>2009-07-22T14:10:04+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/athletic-footwear-and-running-injuries-1</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I think this is one of the best articles I&#39;ve read that details the harmful effects of modern running shoes: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quickswood.com/my_weblog/2006/08/athletic_footwe.html&quot;&gt;Athletic Footwear and Running Injuries&lt;/a&gt;.

They absolutely stank and a lovely cheesy smell followed me whenever I wore them, and even after I&#39;d taken them off and washed my feet (it wasn&#39;t me, I promise).  Sadly washing them normally (ie in the washing machine) and allowing to dry completely didn&#39;t completely relieve them of their smell and they were soon creating a fugg around me again within a run or two. As you can image, the Mrs was not happy at all - &quot;&lt;em&gt;he normally smells so nice&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Thankfully all was not lost.  A simple soak over night in a bucket of warm water with about a cup of white spirit vinegar soon cleared the smell.  They now have a weak vinegary smell, despite a thorough rinsing, but this is no where near as bad as the stench they used to have. People also can&#39;t smell the vinegar from across the room and the wife is happy too &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;   The smell of vinegar should wear off relatively quickly, and should hopefully extend the time until the next vinegar bath. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From my quick research, it appears this is quite a common complaint with the topic popping up on numerous forums, though none of the complaints are quite as amusing as this rendition I found by &lt;a href=&quot;http://patrickhdonnelly.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Patrick Donnelly&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://board.crossfit.com/showthread.php?t=37021&quot;&gt;Crossfit forum&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibram Inc.,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been an owner of a pair of FiveFinger Sprints for over a year now, and have slowly grown accustomed to using them for everyday life. In fact, about three weeks ago when I moved to college, I began using them as nearly my only footwear. There&#39;s one problem with that: they stink.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They don&#39;t just smell, they stink. They omit a foul stench that stalks me throughout the day; an odor so pungent that it surpasses anything any of my senses have ever sensed; a fetor so abrasive to the nostrils that a mere sniff of it could drive a man mad. It&#39;s rather unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The smell began after two days of rain, where I, riding my bike around campus to get from place to place, had gotten my Vibrams thoroughly soaked. Luckily, there&#39;s not much fabric to them, so they dried quickly. After noticing the smell, I washed them, which caused the smell to subside. A week and a half later, the smell had recollected its forces and began to hurl further barrages of odors. Naturally, I washed them again - once again, the smell retreated. Yet, it still was not vanquished. Now the smell is back again, with a vengeance, stronger than ever, dead set on wreaking havoc upon everything in its path! It must be stopped once and for all!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, yeah. It&#39;s stinking up the whole dorm room and even leaking into the halls. How do I fix this for good? I know that when you&#39;re completely barefoot, your feet don&#39;t acquire a smell because it&#39;s difficult for the bacteria to grow when all the sweat evaporates so quickly. The Vibrams seem to be a refugee camp for those exiled bacteria. I can&#39;t simply keep washing them, since not only do I lack the laundry to warrant the washes, but I lack the quarters to fund them. That&#39;s completely ignoring the fact that the smell is recurring with each wash, and getting stronger each time too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated by myself and by my roommate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Take care,&lt;br /&gt;\nPatrick Donnelly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no indication if a response was actually received, but there are a lot of other good suggestions for cleaning and keeping your Vibram Five Fingers smelling clean and fresh in the post.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Show Off Your Vibrams</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/show-off-your-vibrams\"/>\n   <updated>2009-07-10T16:43:45+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/show-off-your-vibrams</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just recently stumbled upon a great site dedicated to the world of &quot;&lt;em&gt;feet as they were designed to be—unshod and free&lt;/em&gt;&quot; with a big dedication to Vibram Five Fingers - &lt;a href=&quot;http://birthdayshoes.com/&quot;&gt;birthdayshoes.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re feeling apprehensive about going out in your Vibrams (you shouldn&#39;t be: I wear mine all the time when I&#39;m not at work or barefoot and have only had 1 comment, from a toddler of all people), take a squizz through this site and see all the pictures people have submitted of them in their &lt;acronym title=&quot;Vibram Five Fingers&quot;&gt;VFF&lt;/acronym&gt;.

By shoes, I mean those heavy, expensive things with huge wadges of foam and rubber and laces - not Vibrams or other minimalistic &quot;foot protectors&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The reason is plain and simple: it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Now for a bit of background into this decision.  Monday was a bank holiday here in the UK.  It started off a bit dull and grey, but the sun soon prevailed and it turned into a glorious day, so the wife and I went out for a nice long walk in the sunshine around some nearby lakes.  I&#39;ve been wearing my Vibrams more and more recently, not just for running, but also for things like cycling into and walking around town, and I thought I&#39;d wear them for our long stroll.  Brilliant idea.  As expected, it felt great and no complaints after over 3 hours of continuous walking on tar, gravel and grass.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As can be expected in the UK (we measure summer by hours, not months), the next morning was grey and very wet.  Instead of a run, I thought I&#39;d hit the rower for a bit of indoor fitness.  This only lasted 13 minutes as the fire alarm went off.  I was a bit naughty here: instead of dropping everything and getting out of the building to stand in the peeing rain whilst someone walked into the kitchen to confirm that the catering staff had forgotten to turn off the smoke alarms over the cooker, I snuck into the change rooms, grabbed by ID badge and took a run round the office block - in my trainers.  Hey, if I&#39;m going to be in the rain, I may as well take advantage of the time and do something useful &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; . Bad idea - the shoe part that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t actively try and run any differently than usual.  I just ran and quite enjoyed the short run too.  No problems during the run, but as the day wore on, the pains started to appear.  The inner lower part of my shins started to feel very tender - almost bruised.  I haven&#39;t had this feeling in a very very long time and I can only put that down to not running in shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, things felt much better on Wednesday morning and Wednesday&#39;s run in Vibrams was good and the day ended without any niggles what-so-ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now this isn&#39;t a scientific study, but a very simple personal test that quickly showed that running in shoes unintentionally changes my running style and to the detriment of my body.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s it.  No more running in shoes for me.  It&#39;s barefoot, Vibrams (or similar) or no run from now on.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Tim Ferris Discovers Vibram Five Fingers</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tim-ferris-discovers-vibram-five-fingers\"/>\n   <updated>2009-05-09T11:48:27+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tim-ferris-discovers-vibram-five-fingers</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Tim Ferris, the author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/4-hour-Work-Week-Escape-Anywhere/dp/0091923727/?tag=costest-21&quot;&gt;The 4-hour Work Week&lt;/a&gt; and a very popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; has just discovered the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/05/07/vibram-five-fingers-shoes/&quot;&gt;virtues of Vibram Five Fingers&lt;/a&gt;.

He advises walking barefoot for a few weeks to toughen up the skin on the bottom of the foot as well as the muscles in the ankles and feet. Once you are ready to run, start with a mere five minutes, increasing slowly and running barefoot every couple of days. From there, build to up to 20 minutes over a month. After a few weeks of this, the feet and ankles will be stronger, thus reducing the risk of injury. Possible places to train include sandy beaches and golf courses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The barefoot running technique has been described as falling forward. It has also been described as gently kissing the ground with the balls of your feet. If you need one more concept to meditate on while running barefoot, imagine that a log is lying across the path in front of you; you don’t want to kick the front of the log with your toes. You want to step over the log with each step, keeping your knee bent and placing the ball of your foot immediately behind the log as your chest moves over the top of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The article is a good read and provides some useful information and answers some questions people have about the thought of running barefoot  My favourite question answered is...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What do you use for arch support?” some might ask. “My arch,” is probably usually the first answer that pops out of the mouth of die-hard barefooters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Damn right.  That&#39;s what it&#39;s there for &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt; .  Time for another barefoot run for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you think you get strange looks running with Vibrams, you should see the looks you get when running completely &lt;acronym title=&quot;barefoot in my native Sefrican&quot;&gt;kaalvoet&lt;/acronym&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Starting Running Barefoot From Scratch</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/starting-running-barefoot-from-scratch\"/>\n   <updated>2009-04-28T10:25:53+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/starting-running-barefoot-from-scratch</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I received a &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-completely-barefoot-run#comment-41&quot;&gt;great question&lt;/a&gt; in the comments on my post about my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-completely-barefoot-run&quot;&gt;first completely barefoot run&lt;/a&gt;, and rather than reply in the comments where it may be hidden from others, I thought I&#39;d reply via a post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The question is...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys - never really been into running but have been thinking about getting into some serious running! Have seen quite a number of links and websites about barefoot running, and given that I&#39;m barefoot a lot during the summer I&#39;m wondering whether I should go straight for Vibram/barefoot running rather than learning and then un-learning with running shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What advice would you guys give?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First off, welcome to the world of running, and it&#39;s great to hear your considering barefoot running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My advice would be to start running barefoot from the very beginning.  As you&#39;re not a runner now, you won&#39;t have any bad habits, expensive shoes or any anxiety about getting back to previous fitness levels and speeds, so the only thing really holding you back is your body.  And that&#39;s the important part as it&#39;s going to be your biggest limiting factor at first and if you&#39;re not careful, it will be the part that will scare you away from running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;By starting running completely barefoot from the beginning, you have no choice but to take it slowly and gently - your feet won&#39;t allow you to over-do it. Over time you&#39;ll find you can run further and further and find each successive run more comfortable and enjoyable.  This slow progressive increase in distance and time will help your body adapt to the new rigors of running and should significantly reduce the chances of getting any injuries, and hopefully completely prevent them.  You&#39;ll also be ensuring you run with good form as you&#39;ll soon find out if your form is bad as it&#39;ll hurt straight away - your feet will let you know the moment you land, rather than letting your bones or muscles tell you days, weeks or even months later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you&#39;re starting from scratch, start with some short barefoot walks on grass - you may not need to worry about this too much as you already spend a fair amount of time barefoot already.  As you become more comfortable with this, pick things up to a gentle jog every now and then. For example mix 5 mins of walking with 30 sec of jogging and then decrease the walking times and increase the jogging times as your fitness improves and your feet strengthen, but be sure to stop as soon as your feet start to feel tender or anything else starts to feel a bit uncomfortable.  Once you&#39;re comfortable with running on the grass, start introducing some barefoot walking on smooth pavements and roads.  Once the road/pavement walks become comfortable you can start throwing in the odd jog and do the same thing with the hard stuff as you did with the grass.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll probably have a bit of muscle soreness in the first few weeks, but this is par for the course when taking on any form of exercise, however this should only be muscle soreness and should subside after a couple of days and you&#39;ll soon be running without any muscle soreness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially, you want to take things carefully and slowly.  You may find your fitness levels will improve quicker than your feet can strengthen, so always listen to your feet.  This is what I believe is one of the motivating factors for running barefoot: by not wearing shoes, your feet will tell you when you&#39;re doing something wrong straight away and you can correct instantly and prevent an injury.  It&#39;s like touching something hot - your fingers tell you straight away and you react so you don&#39;t burn yourself.  The same thing happens with your feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to get some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/&quot;&gt;Vibrams&lt;/a&gt;, then by all means, but save it until you&#39;re running regularly without any discomfort at the time or after running.  Then limit their use for longer runs and offroad/trail running when you&#39;re likely to encounter more stones or more &quot;wear-and-tear&quot;.  They don&#39;t block out the sensation of trodding on stones, however they do make it more tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this answers your question and I hope you enjoy running barefoot.  Despite the strange looks, it&#39;s well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">The Painful Truth About Trainers</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/the-painful-truth-about-trainers\"/>\n   <updated>2009-04-21T14:45:54+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/the-painful-truth-about-trainers</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a great article on the Daily Mail site about running barefoot: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1170253/The-painful-truth-trainers-Are-expensive-running-shoes-waste-money.html&quot;&gt;The painful truth about trainers: Are running shoes a waste of money?&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#39;m slowly building up the &quot;time on my feet&quot; to get my body and feet used to running.  This is mainly an injury prevention measure. I&#39;m also trying to stick to the old adage that you shouldn&#39;t increase your mileage by more than 10% a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the moment I&#39;m up to 2x 18-20 min gentle runs a week with one in Vibrams and one in shoes, and 2-3 weights sessions in the gym broken up into upper body and lower body workouts (this is actually a major cut in the amount of gym work I used to do so is also taking a fair amount of getting used to).  The runs have been going really well and I&#39;ve not felt the slightest bit of pain or discomfort in either my feet or calves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That is until I tried something different on Monday.  Foolishly, I thought I might see if I can start throwing some speed work in to the mix and to get things going, thought I&#39;d determine my Billat pace (aka vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;) (mistake 1), in my Vibrams (mistake 2).  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I took a leisurely jog down to a nearby park which has a path around it that is about a mile long (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mapmyrun.com/run/united-kingdom/reading/479660363&quot;&gt;mapmyrun.com route&lt;/a&gt;) with 100m markers all the way round.  As is needed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brianmac.co.uk/vvo2max.htm&quot;&gt;calculating&lt;/a&gt; your Billat pace (I first mentioned it in the context of &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/billat-pace-rowing&quot;&gt;rowing before&lt;/a&gt;), I blasted my way round and managed to cover about 1570m in my six minutes (for those that are interested, that makes my Billat pace about &lt;acronym title=&quot;6 / 0.975552772mls = 6.150359234 min/ml = 6:09/mile&quot;&gt;6:09/mile&lt;/acronym&gt; or &lt;acronym title=&quot;6 / (1570m/1000m) = 3.821656051 min/km = 3:49/km&quot;&gt;3:49/km&lt;/acronym&gt;).  I stuck to the grass verge and actually really enjoyed running fast again, but sadly my legs and feet weren&#39;t too happy the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The muscles in my feet are feeling very tired and my calves very stiff.  Based on this, I&#39;d say my form goes to pot when I run fast (need more practice &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; ) and I really need to concentrate on building my base a bit more, so no more grease-lightening runs for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, the gently-gently approach is working very well and I&#39;m getting in a good mix of shod and Vibram-ed runs and will continue building up a good solid base before diving back into speed work.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Arctic Shower</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/arctic-shower\"/>\n   <updated>2009-03-13T09:01:08+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/arctic-shower</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Ah, there&#39;s nothing like an arctic shower to start your day.

Only a short 10 minute stint today in shoes, but I&#39;m feeling good and my feet are feeling good.  Hopefully it&#39;ll be plain sailing from now on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My plan for this week is to give my feet a chance to adjust to the joys of running again, in shoes, and get back into the Vibrams next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Vibram Running Experiences So Far</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vibram-running-experiences-so-far\"/>\n   <updated>2009-01-07T16:48:15+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vibram-running-experiences-so-far</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I received a great comment on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/billat-pace-rowing&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; that I thought deserves a post of it&#39;s own in response.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jason&#39;s comment was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;\nWhat a great find regards V Billat. Some good stuff on that pponline site. Have read other V02 stuff on there but that was another level. Have been following your blog as I am experimenting with vibrams myself. Like all other blogs I have read, sore/stiff calf muscles are a right of passage as muscles that have been dormant re-awake. My own observation has been the distinct lack of joint pain following a run. Only doing 2 - 3 miles at a time. But when I go back to shoes my knees suffer for 3 - 4 days after.&lt;br /&gt;\n1 question if I may. On your runs in the vibrams, how did your pace compare to running in shoes?&lt;br /&gt;\nI ask as I seem to be clocking = or better than in shoes. I did not expect this or at least not yet.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First off, it&#39;s great hear there&#39;s someone else trying to run in the Vibrams, but more importantly, great news about the lack of joint pain after running in them.  Sounds like nature may be telling you something there Jason.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The question itself is why I thought it best to provide a post of it&#39;s own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;I&#39;ve not had a chance to do much in the way of distance as I was silly enough to switch to the Vibrams full time whilst I still had the remnants of an old injury, but for those runs I did get in, I found my Vibram times were mostly quicker than my shoe runs and with less effort too.  I believe it&#39;s the way they encourage you to run, rather than the lack of weight, that is responsible for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve found running in the the Vibrams seems to encourage a lighter and more fluid running style. I&#39;m a forefoot striker so never really thought my running style was being affected by the braking effect commonly seen with heel striking, but switching to the Vibrams soon let me know I was experiencing some sort of braking effect (which may explain the shin splints and knee injuries I used to get in shoes) - running in my usual style just didn&#39;t feel 100% right - it felt quite jarring, so I had to adapt. It was this jarring and need for change that made me look into my running style and is what got me onto the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.posetech.com/&quot;&gt;POSE technique&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Running in the Vibrams provides instant feedback via your feet and you soon learn to adapt.  I think it&#39;s this adaption that leads to more efficient and graceful running, which in turn leads to the quicker times with less effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aaaahhhh... all this talk of running is killing me.  I&#39;m so eager to get running again, but I have to be patient: I want to be 100% sure all injuries have healed - I don&#39;t want to be stuck on this rower any longer than I need to be. The rower does have one advantage though: it&#39;s a great opportunity to shed the Christmas weight &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re running barefoot, or in Vibrams, let me know your experiences.

Well, simple really: as you&#39;ll recall from my previous post, I&#39;m not running at the moment and am using rowing to keep fit instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This month&#39;s  UK edition of Runner&#39;s World (January &#39;09) has an article on a method of training devised by Veronique Billat.  The basic principle is you determine your vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; max and then train at that level using varying intervals.  I&#39;m a big fan of intervals (I know, I&#39;m insane) and was quite eager to try this out however due to my self-imposed running &quot;embargo&quot;, this is currently off the cards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fear not, I turned to my good friend - t&#39;Internet - to see if I could find details on using this approach for rowing.  Well, the best source of info I could find was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/0350.htm&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; which provides quite generic instructions, but doesn&#39;t explicitly mention rowing, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brianmac.co.uk/vvo2max.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which provides a bit more info and a handy calculator.  As the instructions are quite generic, I couldn&#39;t see any reason why it shouldn&#39;t be possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve decided to see if I could apply the principles to rowing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Yesterday I did about 10 mins of gentle rowing and then blasted my way through 6 mins of hard fast rowing to see how far I could get in that time - 1598m.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now to calculate my vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; max:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n   Distance / seconds \r\n=  1598 / 360\r\n=  4.44 metres / second\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t particularly useful when it comes to rowing as the rowing machines I have access to show pace in time per 500m, so  converting this to time per 500m should make things easier...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n  6/((Distance/1000m)*2)\r\n= 1:53 mins / 500m\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So in order to row at my vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; max pace, I need to be rowing at a pace of 1min 53 secs per 500m.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My next challenge was to determine my tvVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; max.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With my vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; max pace, I set to determining my tvVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; max this morning. I should probably have left it a couple more days, but I was too anxious to get going.  My tvVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; max came in at 1890m.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, a few technical bits that are worth considering in the context of this post:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;all rowing is done with a drag setting of about 130&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I was very honest with myself when calculating my vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; and tvVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; settings:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;: I used the timer to ensure I could get an accurate distance for 6 mins.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;tvVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;: I allowed for a fluctuation of 3 seconds per 500m in either direction on my vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; pace as keeping a consistent pace is a bit hard.  I took my distance reading as soon as I hit 3 consecutive strokes that were 3 or more seconds above my vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; pace.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now I have my figures, I can go about training using Billat pace on the rower.  I&#39;ll keep you updated as I progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Goals on Hold For The Moment</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals-on-hold-for-the-moment\"/>\n   <updated>2008-12-01T16:57:56+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals-on-hold-for-the-moment</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I&#39;ve had to put my goal hunting on hold for the moment.  I really didn&#39;t want to have to do this, but if I&#39;m going to succeed in moving whole-heartedly across to barefoot/Vibram clad running, I have to be sensible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals&quot;&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt; list, you&#39;ll see I&#39;ve started off with two very simple and easy to attain goals:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1km training run, 3x a week without feeling stiff or sore on the days that follow.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2km training run, 3x a week without feeling stiff or sore on the days that follow.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I&#39;ve conquered both of these goals in distance, but not without the latter part - &quot;without feeling stiff or sore on the days that follow&quot; - I&#39;m being very strict with myself here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The stiffness is no longer an issue, it&#39;s the pain in my feet.  The pain in my 2nd metatarsal I &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/last-weeks-runs&quot;&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt; keeps cropping up as soon as I start to increase my distances.  I suspect I may have a slight stress fracture left from my first over-ambitious attempts at running barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So in the interests of injury cure and prevention, I&#39;m taking the next two months off running completely.  No running barefoot, Vibram clad or in shoes.  I&#39;ll be turning to the indoor rower to keep my cardio fitness up in the mean time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think the take home message here is: a little at a time.  This potential injury is due to me taking things too fast, too soon when I first got the idea of barefoot running in my head.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s affecting my calculated approach, which this blog is documenting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully by the end of January my feet will be happy and I can make a concerted effort with running barefoot again.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Now I Have Some Goals</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/now-i-have-some-goals\"/>\n   <updated>2008-11-14T18:54:16+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/now-i-have-some-goals</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve put together a table of &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals/&quot;&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt; I plan to achieve in my quest to be a barefoot runner.

The feeling of freedom far out weighs the metrics.  Anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mapmyrun.com&quot;&gt;mapmyrun.com&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of measuring the distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s run: about 2.92km in 13:43 which works out at about 4:41/km.

This is my little challenge to see if I can go from running in shoes to running the way nature intended: BAREFOOT.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now this isn&#39;t just a whim, it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been considering quite seriously for quite some time and I&#39;m set to begin my journey on...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 2em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Monday 13 October 2008&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Just a little short of 10 years ago, I moved over to the UK from South Africa to see how life in Europe is.  It was essentially a new start for me.  At the time, I was running a lot in South Africa, and actually ran my last 10k road race the week before I flew out.  That was the last time I officially ran a race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On arriving in the UK, the whole prospect of finding a place to live, a job and generally settling in took priority, and as a result, running took a backseat.  Actually, backseat is the wrong word: it was left out of my life entirely.  I did try keeping up the running, but no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn&#39;t get myself to run with any sort of regularity with the weather being the biggest deterrent.  Instead I opted for joining the gym, only after a few too many beers and far too much food &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Joining gym had the right effect and soon I was losing fat and gaining muscle, and lots of it. As part of my gym program I tried to get back into running again, and well, let me just say running on a treadmill has got to be the most boring form of running in the world.  On sunny days I ventured out into the woods or on the road, but my aspirations were short lived: I went too far, too fast and too soon and ended up injured. Time and time again I tried getting back into running, and each time I spent more on running shoes and still ended up injured.  My heart could take the challenge, just my knees and bones couldn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I then turned to correcting my running style, after all I&#39;m a lot heavier now and &quot;fixing&quot; the shoes wasn&#39;t having any effect and that&#39;s when I discovered the POSE method and so far, I&#39;ve been pretty injury free since I started using this method of running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also now got myself a pair of Vibram Five Fingers and absolutely love the natural feel of running in them.  This is pretty much where my desire to move to running barefoot has come from, and the thought that thousands of African runners can&#39;t be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, I&#39;ve set myself the goal of moving from running in shoes to running barefoot and running my first 10K race in the UK barefoot.

Along with most other runners, I arrived with great aspirations of a massive PB and my own goal of running sub-2:45. Boy was I wrong to think this was possible on my first attempt at London.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- more --&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I had such great success at the &lt;a href=&quot;/race-report-abingdon-marathon-2013/&quot;&gt;Abingdon Marathon back in 2013&lt;/a&gt; I stuck to using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hansons-Marathon-Method-Renegade-ebook/dp/B00AWE9686/&quot;&gt;Hansons Marathon Method&lt;/a&gt; for this race, but with a much more ambitious target pace.  With four months of great training and a few fast build up half-marathons under my belt I arrived at the &amp;quot;Fast Good for Age&amp;quot; start area, right at the front of the red start, with plenty of time and confident in my ability to run a great race and dip under 2:45.  The cool overcast and almost windless conditions added to this confidence - it was perfect marathon racing conditions for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 10:10 the fog horn went and we were off.  The race started with a bit of meandering through the suburbs with a relatively thin stream of spectators cheering us on. Keeping to my desired pace was easy here.  At about 4km the crowds started to noticeably thicken and by 5km when the red and blue/green fields merged the crowds were thunderous and incredibly motivating.  I knew there would be a lot of spectators along the route, but I didn&amp;#39;t expect them to start so soon into the race and be so excited, numerous and motivating. Other than a few areas around The Isle of Dogs, most of the route was at least two to three people deep on each side of the road.  Tower Bridge is particularly amazing and motivating... and deafeningly loud.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This proved to be my downfall.  I got so caught up in the cheering from the crowds and the whole exciting atmosphere that I found myself arriving at half-way nearly 3 minutes ahead of schedule and as we all know, starting too fast will never end well, and that&amp;#39;s precisely what happened to me.  Just after the 32k mark the wheels started to come off and my pace dropped dramatically. I had a particularly terrible section through Canary Wharf but thanks to the immense crowds I held on and came out of the slump and managed to finish in a respectable time of &lt;a href=&quot;http://results-2015.virginmoneylondonmarathon.com/2015/?content=detail&amp;amp;fpid=search&amp;amp;pid=search&amp;amp;idp=9999990F5ECC830000171419&amp;amp;lang=EN_CAP&amp;amp;event=MAS&amp;amp;search%5Bname%5D=Seymour&amp;amp;search%5Bfirstname%5D=Colin&amp;amp;search%5Bsex%5D=%25&amp;amp;search%5Bnation%5D=%25&amp;amp;search_sort=name&amp;amp;search_event=MAS&quot;&gt;2:53:34&lt;/a&gt; - a 16 second PB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The little &amp;quot;Over final 7.2k&amp;quot; box in the bottom right of this image gives you an idea of how much I slowed:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/vlm-runpix.png&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;656&quot; height=&quot;635&quot; alt=&quot;VLM runpix&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally I&amp;#39;m the one doing the overtaking, not being overtaken. 247 people passing me isn&amp;#39;t a lot in the grand scheme of things, but it does equate to nearly 25% of the people who finished ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The London Marathon was a brilliant experience and a race I&amp;#39;ll definitely be doing again. I&amp;#39;m really pleased to have run this race and experienced it and more so because, despite the wheels coming a bit loose, I still managed a personal best.  My finishing time qualifies me for a &amp;quot;Good for Age&amp;quot; entry again next year, but I think I might give it a miss and try a different and smaller race.  We&amp;#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now to find a fast autumn marathon in which I won&amp;#39;t get distracted by the crowds so I can have a good go at that sub-2:45 goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">The World&#39;s Fastest Recreational Runners</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/the-worlds-fastest-recreational-runners\"/>\n   <updated>2015-04-24T09:17:44+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/the-worlds-fastest-recreational-runners</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/the-worlds-fastest-everyday-runners/&quot;&gt;this interesting article&lt;/a&gt; from the New York Times which links to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://runrepeat.com/research-marathon-performance-across-nations&quot;&gt;analysis performed by Danish statisticians&lt;/a&gt; on the non-elite finishers of the Amsterdam, Athens, Berlin, Boston, Budapest, Chicago, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Marine Corps (Washington), Paris and Warsaw marathons, between 2009 and 2014, and then determined which were the fastest nations by average finishing time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is interesting idea and the New York Times article opens with:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A new analysis of more than a million recreational marathon participants at major marathons around the world finds that the world’s swiftest amateur marathoners do not share the same nationalities as the world’s elite racers, many of whom come from East Africa. In terms of average pace for its runners, the United States sits near the bottom of the nations included, vastly trailing that marathon powerhouse, Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... and towards the end quotes one of the statisticians with ...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Many see Africa as the marathon continent, but they only dominate in the elite scene,&amp;quot; says Jens Jakob Andersen, a runner and statistician in Haderslev, Denmark, and the lead researcher for the new analysis. &amp;quot;In recreational running, it is not a popular sport.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... and by looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://runrepeat.com/research-marathon-performance-across-nations&quot;&gt;infographic and analysis&lt;/a&gt;, they&amp;#39;re right:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://runrepeat.com/research-marathon-performance-across-nations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/RunRepeat-Graphic.jpg&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Truncated infographic&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... however, as I see it, the data isn&amp;#39;t really representative of the world as a whole and as such doesn&amp;#39;t fully support the comments and conclusions made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;So what&amp;#39;s wrong with the analysis?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; you may ask. Well, two things instantly pop to mind:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The races analysed are not spread out across the world&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst the analysis has been performed on some of the largest and most popular marathons in the world, they&amp;#39;re mostly concentrated in Europe with a few from the US. Not a single African, Asian or Asia-Pacific race has been included in their analysis thus skewing the results.  This is particularly pertinent as it is considerably more expensive to travel from Africa, Asia or Asia-Pacific to Europe and the US than it is to travel in-and-around Europe or from Europe to the US and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Performing a similar analysis of just marathons in Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand would lead to heavy weighting towards nations on that side of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationality of competitors probably isn&amp;#39;t logged for local runners&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my experience, races only register the nationality of runners if they enter via the international registration process. This leaves out all those who may be living temporarily or permanently in the country of the race in question but still identify themselves as being from another country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These two points dramatically cut down on the diversity of the results and limits entries from African, Asian and Asia-Pacific countries to those that are wealthy enough or who have been sponsored to travel to the countries of the races studied.  To me these points also significantly water down and possibly invalidate the claims being made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also not clear what they classify as an &amp;quot;elite&amp;quot; runner. I run sub-3 hours but don&amp;#39;t consider myself elite... far from it.  By London Marathon standards I don&amp;#39;t even qualify for the championship start which is for the super-fast club runners.  I doubt this will affect the results much, but it would have been nice to know this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to see this analysis performed again using a number of races with similar sized fields from many more countries and then see how this compares to the elite performances.  I suspect we&amp;#39;ll see African and Asian countries ranking much higher than they do here.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">What&#39;s Wrong with Free?</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/whats-wrong-with-free\"/>\n   <updated>2015-04-18T04:08:10+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/whats-wrong-with-free</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Once again I find myself in San Francisco for work and I realised the American distrust for free extends to running too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Sunday morning I went for my last long run before the London Marathon and ran the length of the Embarcadero. I like the route as it&amp;#39;s nice and flat, except for the big hill round Fort Mason, and has great views of the bridge and Alcatraz. It&amp;#39;s also a great sunny route so I can top-up on my vitamin D at the same time. Anyway, my run was cut short because of an event starting and finishing at Crissy Field, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://guardsmen.org/presidio10/race-info.html&quot;&gt;Presidio 10 Mile/10KM/5KM&lt;/a&gt;.  I knew this event was on but chose not to enter any of them as a) I didn&amp;#39;t want to tempt fate by racing so close to London, b) I had other plans for a long run already scheduled and c) I objected to paying what I consider an exorbitant entry fee. And it&amp;#39;s this last point that I want to come back to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- more --&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 5K race had &lt;a href=&quot;http://results.chronotrack.com/event/results/event/event-13531?lc=en&quot;&gt;727 finishers&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom paid between $35 and $45 to run those 5 kilometers. $35??!! And all they got for their money and time was a T-shirt.  Saturday morning, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.us/crissyfield/&quot;&gt;Crissy Field parkrun&lt;/a&gt;, which takes place in the exact same place, which costs absolutely NOTHING had 19 finishers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the affliction with free?  parkrun is not an inferior product.  Yes, you don&amp;#39;t get a T-shirt and medal after each run, but you do after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.com/about/our-clubs/&quot;&gt;50, 100, 250 etc&lt;/a&gt; but that&amp;#39;s not the point. It&amp;#39;s about getting out and having fun and keeping healthy all for the handsome price of nothing, zip, nada, not a penny. And best of all, officially timed results each and every time.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Strava Labs FlyBy</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/strava-labs-flyby\"/>\n   <updated>2015-02-28T12:09:15+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/strava-labs-flyby</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I discovered another of Strava&amp;#39;s experimental features the other day: &lt;a href=&quot;http://labs.strava.com/flyby/&quot;&gt;FlyBy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what is it? It&amp;#39;s a site that will let you know who you passed or &amp;quot;flew by&amp;quot; while you were out running or riding.  It puts together all the logged runs that crossed or came very close to your uploaded run and then lets you replay your run/ride to see exactly where you passed the other runners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;!--more--&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kind of cool but not really useful, except maybe to learn the name of the rude runner who didn&amp;#39;t wave back on your long run this morning or to stalk the handsome/pretty man/lady who&amp;#39;s derriere you gazed at non-stop for countless hours.  Actually, that&amp;#39;s a pretty good use... now you can work out precisely home long you were looking at her bum &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:&#39; alt=&#39;😜&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f61c.svg&#39;&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another useful feature is I can fire up LICEcap (a terrible gif screen capture tool but pretty good at what it does) and create a gif of today&amp;#39;s Reading parkrun to show you how it went:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/flyby.gif&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;Reading parkrun on FlyBy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m the red one &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure this will become particularly popular but it&amp;#39;s a nice way to kill a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">First Test of London Training</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-test-of-london-training\"/>\n   <updated>2015-02-08T08:28:18+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-test-of-london-training</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;The first test of my London Marathon training is today: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wokinghamhalfmarathon.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Wokingham Half Marathon&lt;/a&gt;.

I also plan to do the local parkruns, where available, when I&amp;#39;m travelling, which will be much easier now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.us/crissyfield/&quot;&gt;San Francisco has one&lt;/a&gt; - I&amp;#39;m often in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So without much further ado, here are a few statistics from my 50 parkruns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;4 run completely barefoot&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;7 different parkruns: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/&quot;&gt;Reading&lt;/a&gt; (40), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/woodley/&quot;&gt;Woodley&lt;/a&gt; (2), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.co.za/delta/&quot;&gt;Delta Park&lt;/a&gt; (2), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/black-park/&quot;&gt;Black Park&lt;/a&gt; (2), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/newbury/&quot;&gt;Newbury&lt;/a&gt; (2), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/FrimleyLodge/&quot;&gt;Frimley Lodge&lt;/a&gt; (1), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/rushmoor/&quot;&gt;Rushmoor&lt;/a&gt; (1)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;11 personal bests&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3 first places&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lowest position: 16, my very first parkrun&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fastest time: &lt;code&gt;17:10&lt;/code&gt; at Reading&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Slowest time: &lt;code&gt;21:43&lt;/code&gt; at Delta Park - I blame altitude and it&amp;#39;s a tough course.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Favourite parkrun: Delta Park. It&amp;#39;s a challenging course with tons of nostalgia attached as I used to run school cross-country in Delta Park.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My next target is the 100 club, though I plan to join that club in a significantly quicker timeframe... just over a year should do it &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">2014 In Summary</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2014-in-summary\"/>\n   <updated>2015-01-12T18:22:39+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2014-in-summary</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;2014 was not the best year for running for me. I went into the year with &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/2013-in-summary/&quot;&gt;so many plans and aspirations&lt;/a&gt; and nothing came of them. Why?  Injury, and right at the beginning of the year too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It all began in January. It was a fine sunny morning and I found myself in San Francisco again.  I woke up on the morning of the 21st and headed down to the Embarcadero for my scheduled interval session - 6x 800m with 400m recovery. These turned out to be quite tough due to jetlag and not eating breakfast.  It was however during one of the intervals that I went over on my right ankle.  I thought nothing of it and jogged it off as you normally do.  Things were a little tender on the next few runs but I managed to get through a few easy runs.  Then on the plane home my ankle blew up and the pain set in.  This took me out of running for pretty much the next few months and being the anxious and eager runner I am, I probably attempted to run each time sooner than I really should have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Racing&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result I ended up pulling out of the Shakespeare and Giant&amp;#39;s Head marathons, both of which I&amp;#39;d paid for in advance, and only ran two races, excluding parkruns, all year. I took part in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ragnarrelay.com/race/napavalley/&quot;&gt;Ragnar Napa Valley relay&lt;/a&gt; (reminds me, I still need to finish this post) with eleven of my colleagues and the Bournemouth Marathon, both of which went a lot better than I expected.  The only redeeming thing is the Wokingham half marathon was cancelled due to flooding so I didn&amp;#39;t miss out on that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Training&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully my ankle has held out for the last part of the year so I&amp;#39;ve managed to get in quite a bit of training towards the end of the year.  I&amp;#39;ve also worked out what is likely to have caused me going over on my ankle... I&amp;#39;ve worked out that when I run slowly on my easy runs, I have a tendency to over-relax my ankles.  This seems to lead to instability which in turn triggers the pain on the outside of my right leg.  Concentrating on landing on the balls of my feet without overly relaxing my ankles seems to do the trick and has allowed me to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not all doom and gloom though. Thanks to work, I&amp;#39;ve been lucky enough to run several times in San Francisco, including right the way through Golden Gate Park to the ocean and back again and along the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/marin-headlands-are-still-waiting-for-me/&quot;&gt;Coastal Trail from Golden Gate Bridge to Golden Gate Park&lt;/a&gt;, Amsterdam and I also found myself in Vegas so run The Strip from the Wynn hotel right down to the famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite not being able to run much in the early part of the year, I have managed to keep living a mostly carb-free life and am still enjoying the benefits and the way I feel.  I definitely notice when I&amp;#39;ve been eating processed carbs, especially sugar, and continue to try and avoid them.  I&amp;#39;m flexible though as it&amp;#39;s not always possible and desired given all the travelling I&amp;#39;ve been doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#39;s on the Cards for 2015?&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;London Marathon in under 2:50\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/vlm-2015-youre-in/&quot;&gt;I have a &amp;quot;Good for Age&amp;quot; place&lt;/a&gt; based on my Abingdon Marathon time from 2013 so will be using the first part of the year to build up for it.  A sub-2:45 would be amazing, but given the number of people and the route, I suspect I may not get this so I&amp;#39;ve got another goal of dipping under 2:50.  We&amp;#39;ll see if that happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 parkrun milestone\nThis shouldn&amp;#39;t be too hard to get this year as I&amp;#39;ve only got 3 more to go, but more importantly, I plan to do more parkruns &amp;quot;just as a run&amp;quot; rather than treat them as mini-races or speed sessions like I used to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rally my colleagues to run the Ragnar Napa Relay again\nThis was such a great event that it would be insane not to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:hammer:&#39; alt=&#39;🔨&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f528.svg&#39;&gt; those PBs\nI&amp;#39;m fast approaching 40 so will soon have to accept I&amp;#39;ll never be fast again and will have to settle for &amp;quot;Fast for age PBs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep up the LCHF lifestyle\nThis is proving to be the right thing for me.  The only real change I plan to make is cut down on the beer and drink more cider instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s 2014 in a quick summary.  A very disappointing year for running.  Hopefully 2015 will be much better and a lot more like 2013.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Tricking The Mind to a Sub-2 Hour Marathon</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tricking-the-mind-to-sub-2-hour-marathon\"/>\n   <updated>2014-12-21T13:28:26+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tricking-the-mind-to-sub-2-hour-marathon</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in the process of reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Faster-Higher-Stronger-Generation-Superathletes---ebook/dp/B00INIXN9Q/&quot;&gt;Faster, Higher, Stronger: How Sports Science Is Creating a New Generation of Superathletes--and What We Can Learn from Them by Mark McClusky&lt;/a&gt; - a great read so far - and I&amp;#39;ve just read chapter 8 &amp;quot;What Getting Tired Means&amp;quot;.  It&amp;#39;s a chapter that talks about how science and research has changed the definition of what fatigue is and talks about how it is likely to be more of a mental state than a physical state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It covers Tim Noakes&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_governor&quot;&gt;central governor theory&lt;/a&gt; and how various mental stimuli can be used to reduce the sense of fatigue and how drugs have been known to do the same thing.  One little thing they brought up was the topic of tricking the mind by manipulating a runner&amp;#39;s watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking... how likely are we to get that sub-2 hour marathon if Dennis Kimetto&amp;#39;s (or any other elite athlete) coach/manager and the Berlin marathon race organisers &amp;quot;rigged&amp;quot; things to make Dennis think he&amp;#39;s running slower than he really is?  What if they colluded to make Dennis&amp;#39;s wristwatch and the clock on the lead car to run deliberately fast by a second or two per kilometer?  Would this be enough to drive him to run even quicker and break the two hour mark or would he soon realise something was suss?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an interesting thing to ponder, especially as elite athletes are probably right on the edge of what they can do in terms of physicality without resorting to drugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chapter did bring up another topic which intrigues me and which I&amp;#39;m looking into now: &amp;quot;brain endurance training&amp;quot;. The idea is you perform mentally fatiguing exercises before and during training with the aim of reducing mental fatigue and perception of effort whilst racing. The book mentions some pretty amazing and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesportinmind.com/articles/brain-training-improving-performance-from-your-lounge-room-2/&quot;&gt;impressive results from research performed by Samuele Marcora&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the University of Kent, that is definitely worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marcora is apparently working with British Athletic in their preparations for Rio so it&amp;#39;ll be interesting to see how this research pans out over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, I&amp;#39;m off to scour the interwebs and I might start doing tough sudokus before my runs &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Marin Headlands are Still Waiting for Me</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/marin-headlands-are-still-waiting-for-me\"/>\n   <updated>2014-11-09T19:23:15+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/marin-headlands-are-still-waiting-for-me</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I find myself in San Francisco again this week and when planning my trip, booked an AirBnB in Lower Haight so I&amp;#39;d be closer to Golden Gate park and Presidio.  The intent behind this decision was to see what it&amp;#39;s like to &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; in another &amp;#39;hood in San Francisco, but more importantly I had the idea that one of my runs would take me the full length of Golden Gate park so I could wet my feet in the sea and run back again and another would take me through the Presidio, across Golden Gate bridge, up to Marin Headlands (for the obligatory snap of Golden Gate bridge with San Francisco in the background) and back again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I ticked off the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strava.com/activities/216924680&quot;&gt;run the lengths of Golden Gate park, touch the ocean and run back&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; run and this morning I tried the Marin Headlands run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke this morning to the common sight of fog over San Francisco, but as the sun came up, it soon started to burn off so I headed off feeling quite confident it would be all clear by the time I got to Marin Headlands. I was also feeling great after 9 hours of sleep - I hope this is the sleep that broke the jet lag.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All was good until I got to the edge of Golden Gate bridge... the footpath was closed until 10:30am for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mermaidseries.com/#!__san-francisco&quot;&gt;Mermaid Series 10 mile race&lt;/a&gt; that was taking place. I thought, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Oooo, maybe they&amp;#39;re allowing pedestrians to use the west side of the bridge during the race&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; - this side is normally only open to cyclists... nope. I got to the west side and was told... &amp;quot;NOPE! Wait until the race is finished at 10:30 or use the shuttle to cross and walk back.&amp;quot;  I got to the bridge just after 8:30 and there was no way I was going to wait 2 hours.  I also decided against using the shuttle to cross and run back as it was still very foggy and didn&amp;#39;t look like it would be clearing any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, I ran the Coastal trail back towards Golden Gate park.  Lovely trail and I&amp;#39;m sure the sights would have been brilliant had it not been for the fog.  All I could see were trees, fog and the path.  I did hear a lot of boats on their horns as they entered the bay which was quite unusual for me.  I also ran past some pretty swish looking houses (some with astroturf front lawns) and got to run a route I&amp;#39;d only planned doing some other time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe height=&#39;405&#39; width=&#39;590&#39; frameborder=&#39;0&#39; allowtransparency=&#39;true&#39; scrolling=&#39;no&#39; src=&#39;https://www.strava.com/activities/217419869/embed/9dddd11c53206613246911d1946aad0279ad966a&#39;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So whilst I&amp;#39;m a little disappointed I couldn&amp;#39;t go the Marin Headlands today, I&amp;#39;m happy I still had a good run on the Coastal Trail and also slightly pleased I didn&amp;#39;t make the effort as I suspect all I would have seen was white. If anything, I&amp;#39;m more annoyed with myself for not thinking to lookup to see if there were any races in the city whilst I&amp;#39;m here - I may have been able to enter this one on the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ooooo, I&amp;#39;ve just had an idea... maybe next time I&amp;#39;m over I&amp;#39;ll catch the shuttle or ferry across to Sausalito, spend the morning or afternoon running the trails of the Marin Headlands and then catch the shuttle or ferry back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right, time for a shower as I&amp;#39;m really starting to smell now.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Spartathlon in Luna Sandals</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/spartathlon-in-luna-sandals\"/>\n   <updated>2014-11-09T19:22:58+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/spartathlon-in-luna-sandals</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;People thought I was nuts running the Ragnar Relay and Bournemouth Marathon in Luna Sandals, but this guy takes the biscuit.

Whilst in San Francisco in the last week of January I woke up one morning with a slightly tender right ankle. Being the silly arse that I am, I went for a run in the glorious sunshine.  A gentle 2km warm up seemed to loosen things up and I broke into my planned 800m intervals with 600m recovery along the Embarcadero.  This was a great workout, except for the recovery runs... my right ankle really wasn&#39;t too happy with those.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, to cut a long story short, I&#39;ve not really gone much further than about 5km since as my right ankle keeps flaring up.  I suspect it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eorthopod.com/content/peroneal-tendon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;peroneal tendonitis&lt;/a&gt; but I&#39;ve not gone to the doctors yet.  I&#39;ll give it a few more weeks before seeking expert advice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in order to stop myself becoming a great big fat lazy oaf and to try and keep some sort of semblance of fitness (and sanity) in the slight hope I might actually get to run enough to actually finish the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shakespearemarathon.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shakespeare Marathon&lt;/a&gt; at the end of April I&#39;ve been cycling, swimming and going to the gym with the gym part being the most boring.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nToday I got this crazy idea (Tom Williams from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marathontalk.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marathon Talk&lt;/a&gt; is also partly to blame as he&#39;s incorporating CrossFit into his training this year) that I could try a few CrossFit exercises in the gym to get a bigger bang for my buck and found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/009141.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Workout of the Day&quot; (WoD):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;WoD 140301&quot; src=&quot;/assets/WoD-140301.png&quot; width=&quot;483&quot; height=&quot;163&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sounds easy enough, except for the 95lb (approx 43kg) barbell part: there&#39;s no way I can do 5 thrusters at that weight - I can&#39;t get the weight over my head - let alone 45!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you something, I got this so so wrong.  I seriously misjudged this workout.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m by no means a CrossFit expert but I have speed-read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/faq.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; and have a good idea of how to do most of the exercises from my old weightlifting days.  What I wasn&#39;t sure about was if I was meant to do this in &quot;rounds&quot; (ie 21 thrusters followed by 21 pull-ups etc) or in turn.  I thought rounds so that what I had in mind when I went to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Being cautious, I warmed up and then loaded an olympic bar with a massive 10kg - 5kg per side - taking the bar + weights to 30kg and hit my first set of 21 thrusters.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;OH MY WORD!!! I nearly keeled over. I got to about 13 reps and was so out of breath I had to pause.  By the time I got to 21 I didn&#39;t have the breath or energy to hoik myself up to the pull-up bar for the pull ups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the end I did the thrusters with loads of rest between sets, then the pull-ups - only to failure - and called it a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I got home I looked up this innocently sounding &quot;Fran&quot; workout and discovered this is one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://crossfitrosslyn.com/fran-tips-for-completing-this-benchmark-workout/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;benchmark CrossFit workouts&lt;/a&gt;. I also discovered I&#39;m allowed, and actually encouraged to &quot;cheat&quot; in the pull-ups - it&#39;s called doing kipping pull-ups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Want to see how this workout is done (nothing like how I did it)?, here you go:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/WoWD5BsENTM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The kipping pull-ups look really odd to me, but I guess the idea it to keep the whole body working and not just the arms and back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got my work cut out for me if I&#39;m ever going to get up to doing these with 90lbs of weight without nearly killing myself. I do however now know this is a great one for measuring my progress and will definitely do this properly soon so I&#39;ve got a benchmark to work from.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">2013 in Summary</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2013-in-summary\"/>\n   <updated>2014-01-14T12:41:00+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2013-in-summary</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m only a month and a half late with this, but as they say, &quot;better late than never&quot; &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So how was 2013 for me in terms of running?  Absolutely bloody brilliant in the end.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Training&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started the year off a little slowly.  The weather wasn&#39;t very good and I wasn&#39;t particularly motivated after working the Christmas period having gotten back from visiting family in South Africa.  What training I was doing was mostly the MAF approach with one session of Yasso 800s a week thrown in... the idea was to try and get a bit more speed in my legs in preparation for my first marathon in nearly 10 years.  This served me well, or so I thought. Blowing up spectacularly in the Milton Keynes marathon proved there was no way I was going to get under three hours on MAF alone... I needed more tough workouts that would teach me to run quicker and longer on tired legs.  So I did a bit of research and discovered the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/marathoning-hansons-way?page=single&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hanson Marathon Method&lt;/a&gt;. This struck a chord with me so I bought the book and I switched to the advanced programme of the Hanson Marathon Method and this proved to be a brilliant programme for me.  My mileage increased, my training more consistent and more importantly tougher and more specific to the demands of racing a sub-3 hour marathon. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All this marathon specific training also saw me tick off the most kilometres of running in a year ever of 3236km with 5 months topping 300km of which September was the highest at a whopping 383km.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Races&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can expect all that training paid off and paid off brilliantly in all distances that I raced. I set new lifetime personal bests in all distances I raced and in some of them by a large margin over the year before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Check out my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/a&gt; page for my personal bests as they now stand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I stuck with the paleo-lite/low-carb-high-fat (LCHF) diet as it is proving to work so well for my running and general health and energy levels.  I&#39;ve not been 100% strict, but pretty consistent and I think its this consistency that has allowed me to adapt and take full advantage of all those fat calories.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;On to 2014&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So what&#39;s on the cards for 2014?  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;More training as I&#39;ve entered three marathons spread across the year with the goal of dipping under 2:50 in the third Unfortunately, the training is on a bit of a go-slow as I write this as I&#39;ve developed a suspected stress fracture in my right ankle which I&#39;m putting down to literally hitting the track too hard: I think I went into track sessions with a little too much gusto.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;More marathons: you&#39;ve got to do them to become good at them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;More strength training.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My 50 parkruns T-shirt.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stick with the LCHF diet and try and reduce the amount of beer I drink - this is my one &quot;sin&quot; under the LCHF diet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set new personal bests in all distances.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things started off so well this year before I hurt my ankle so here&#39;s to hoping it heals quickly and I can get back onto the road and back up to my desired and required training volume soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">First Run of 2014: Done</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-run-of-2014-done\"/>\n   <updated>2014-01-02T13:56:27+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-run-of-2014-done</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;First run of 2014...

Come to think of it, if I&#39;m going to be walking on those lovely grassy fairways, I&#39;d rather be running on them, barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, imagine my surprise when I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_golf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;speed golf&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s golf in which the objective is to finish as quickly as possible with the fewest number of strokes.  Each round takes about an hour to an hour-and-a-half instead of who knows how long.  You could probably cover 3-4 rounds of speed golf and get in a good long interval/fartlek session in the time it takes to do one round of normal golf.  Best thing of all, it&#39;s mostly on lovely plush grass so you could do it entirely barefoot too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/zQ43miMu0lw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I might have a reason to learn to play golf now.

Unlike Thugwane, Le Grange never had the opportunity to compete at the Olympic Games because of the international sports boycott against his country, but he was the first athlete to run a sub-2:20:00 marathon on the continent of Africa and set six South African marathon records – the only runner in history to do so more than twice.&lt;br /&gt;\n— &lt;a href=&quot;http://running.competitor.com/2013/11/news/south-africa-loses-famous-marathoner_89015&quot; title=&quot;South Africa Loses Famous Marathoner - Competitor Running&quot;&gt;South Africa Loses Famous Marathoner - Competitor Running&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d never heard of this chap until this article and I&#39;m very surprised and a bit disappointed.  Yes, he retired (at the age of 25) from competitive running before I was born but his records and performances are pretty impressive even by today&#39;s standards.  That said, I grew up in the &quot;Bruce Fordyce gives Comrades another good hiding&quot; era, so maybe that explains why he hasn&#39;t shown up on my radar until now.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Race Report: Abingdon Marathon 2013</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-abingdon-marathon-2013\"/>\n   <updated>2013-10-21T12:20:10+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-abingdon-marathon-2013</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I took my first stab at a sub-3 hour marathon at the Milton Keynes marathon and &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/it-wasnt-my-day-today&quot;&gt;completely misjudged things&lt;/a&gt; and in retrospect probably my abilities at the time, and completely blew it. On Sunday I took another stab at that elusive sub-3 marathon mark in my third ever marathon, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abingdonmarathon.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Abingdon Marathon&lt;/a&gt;, and smashed it out of the ballpark.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following my disappointing run at the Milton Keynes marathon I decided I was going to create a properly structured training programme that would guide me to a great marathon time.  After a little bit of research and reading I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/marathoning-hansons-way?page=single&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marathoning The Hansons&#39; Way&lt;/a&gt;.  Intrigued by this approach and the relative simplicity (compared to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Daniels-Running-Formula-Second-Edition-ebook/dp/B007VFDCCA/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Daniels Runner Formula&lt;/a&gt;), I purchased their book - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hansons-Marathon-Method-Renegade-ebook/dp/B00AWE9686/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hansons Marathon Method&lt;/a&gt; - in Kindle format, read it, and devised my four month training programme.  This ended up being a great programme which I&#39;ll cover that in another post. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;My Performance&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With lots of good hard training in my legs (over 1200km worth) I hit the road Sunday morning with two goals in mind: an absolute &lt;em&gt;&quot;I must get under 3 hours&quot;&lt;/em&gt; goal and a &lt;em&gt;&quot;it would be brilliant if I got under 2 hours 55 mins too&quot;&lt;/em&gt; goal.  Being the optimist that I am, and given my top form this season, I went out aiming for 2h55m from the gun with the idea that I&#39;ll have 5 mins to spare if I over-cook things (not likely) and if I still have something in my legs at the end, I could go faster.  A little bit of pre-calculation determined I&#39;d need to average 4:08/km for 2h55m and just over 4:15/km for 2h:59m:59s so I aimed for 4:08/km, give or take a few seconds due to bunching, hills, water tables and turns for the first half.  This worked well and I actually found it quite hard to hold back at the beginning.  It was so tempting to go out with the tide of over-eager people, but I remained strong and held back knowing that the tide would soon turn and I&#39;d be the one doing all the overtaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Abingdon2013-2-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;In the zone making up my way back up the field&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;In the &quot;zone&quot; making up my way back up the field on the 2nd lap.&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I did a pretty good job of holding back and soon got into a good groove just a little quicker than 4:08/km which saw me through halfway a little ahead of schedule.  Had I stuck to 4:08/km, I&#39;d have gone through halfway in about 1h27m12s.  I went through halfway in 1h26m51s, so pretty close to schedule.  Knowing I was pretty much on schedule I decided I didn&#39;t need to hold back quite so much, so I went with what felt good and stopped concentrating too hard on my pace.  By this time the tide had turned and I was slowly passing people and working my way back up the field and as I got closer to the end, I found the tide was coming in at a rapid rate of knots; I was catching and passing people at quite a clip.  I&#39;d see them ahead of me and without too much effort, they&#39;d soon be behind me and I&#39;d have my eyes set on the next pair of heels ahead of me.  This worked well to keep me occupied during the second lap of the race in which I ended up continuing at about 4:08/km with my one and only sub-4 minute kilometre at 35km (3:42!! what was I thinking?) and a few kilometres around 4:20/km on the little hills (they felt way bigger than they really were) in the last 4 kilometres.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up smashing my previous PB of 3h22m40s set at Milton Keynes by nearly 30 minutes and crossed the line in a gun time of 2h53:58s and a chip time (the one that counts &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;) of 2h53:50s in 27th place (out of 703 finishers).  I didn&#39;t quite achieve a negative split, but I was pretty close with 1h26m51s and 1h26m59s.  I blame the slight hill in the last 4km for this &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To say I&#39;m chuffed is an understatement.  I&#39;m over the moon.  On the way back to the car I said to my wife that I don&#39;t think I&#39;m cut out for marathons as I was feeling knackered, on the verge of cramping and with a tight knot for a stomach but now I&#39;ve had a few days to recover - I&#39;ve recovered surprisingly quickly - I think maybe I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; cut out for these marathons; I just need a bit more practice.  After all, this is only my 3rd marathon and only my fourth race of a 42.2km or more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The Race&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The race itself is a very well organised affair with loads of support, adequate water tables and plenty marshals on route.  Talking of the route, this race is rated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/event-editorial/readers-top-10-uk-races-pb-potential/4965.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Runner&#39;s World readers as the best race for PB potential&lt;/a&gt; and I agree as this is a relatively flat course with an ever-so slight downward trend in the first 5km and a slight upward trend in the last 4km with a little &quot;bump&quot; at about 11km and 26km.  That said, I think a few changes to the route could make it even quicker &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;  Between the 5th and 6th kilometre markers you come off the roads and run along a rather narrow path. This is quite a bottleneck this early in the race and this year proved to be rather muddy too.  The last kilometre is along the winding footpath within Tilsley Park just before you enter the stadium for your last 300m on the tartan track. This is quite tough on the old legs at the end of a marathon.  Oh, and they really need to get the council to come along and temporarily remove the barriers at the entrance to the path between North Quay and Andersey Way; this really breaks your stride as it&#39;s a very narrow gap, barely wider than shoulder width, that requires a fair degree of maneuvering to get through.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Other than that, a very good race.  It&#39;s not surprising this one is so popular and the choice for several country championships.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Other Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A few more incidentals, more for my own records than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I ran in&lt;/strong&gt;: a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Product-View-Road-X-Treme-138.html?L=26&amp;A=Road&amp;G=Male&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inov-8 Road X-treme 138&lt;/a&gt;. These are now my favourite long run and racing flat.  They&#39;re incredibly light (UK8 = 138g), very flexible, offer very little in the way of cushioning, are flat with no heel drop and best off all, they don&#39;t rub between my toes on long runs and in races like Vibram Five Fingers do. I&#39;m going to write a post about these soon.  I still love VFFs, just not racing or running too long in them. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As for nutrition: all LCHF though slightly higher carb than usual as I still need some carbs in my muscles to run a marathon.  My carb of choice is the sweet potato as it has a much lower GI than regular potatoes, none of the nasties of regular potatoes and it&#39;s obviously gluten free.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-race dinner&lt;/strong&gt;: a rather large faggot from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lockeyfarm.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lockey Farm shop&lt;/a&gt; with sweet potato, coconut and chilli mash and roast carrots enjoyed with two small bottles of beer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-race breakfast&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bulletproofexec.com/how-to-make-your-coffee-bulletproof-and-your-morning-too/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a bulletproof coffee&lt;/a&gt;, a heaped teaspoon of almond butter, a small portion of fruit salad made up of pineapple and honeydew melon and about 4 tablespoons of leftover sweet potato mash, all consumed before 7am.  I like to ensure all my eating is done at least 2 hours before the start of the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race supplementation and hydration&lt;/strong&gt;: water and a single homemade &quot;gel&quot; at 28km, though in retrospect I probably didn&#39;t need this.  It was more of a &quot;just in case&quot; thing.  The &quot;gel&quot; was 1 teaspoon almond butter mixed with 1 teaspoon of coconut oil left in the fridge overnight and then warmed in my back pocket until consumed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Hannibal Smith from the A-Team used to say...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love it when a plan comes together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My training, diet, race plan, kit, hydration and nutrition all fell into place perfectly on the day when it counted leading to one of my most enjoyable and best performances ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">The Big Day</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/the-big-day\"/>\n   <updated>2013-10-20T06:44:51+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/the-big-day</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;This is the big day I&#39;ve been training for: the Abingdon Marathon.

Once back in the office, I checked if I could enter on the day - I could - and the previous year&#39;s results and I thought I&#39;d have a chance at a podium finish so decided I&#39;d do it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning I popped down to TVP, registered and entered the race.  As is common with races people shoot off from the start and a group of about 8 guys headed off ahead of me.  I wasn&#39;t too worried and played things safe and ran at my own pace.  I was soon up in 5th place and then started reeling in the guys ahead of me. I was in 4th by 6km with the third place guy in my sights: first and second were long gone and out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I then closed the gap on the third place guy and was hot on his heels by the 8km mark.  At this point he seemed to slow down, so I slowed a little too as I wasn&#39;t sure if he was going to try and burn me at the end.  I soon determined his legs were shot and there was no way he was going to keep up with me, so I took him and pulled a comfortable gap with about 1km to go.  It was at this point I noticed that the 2nd place chap wasn&#39;t actually that far ahead of me.  I think with a bit of effort I could have caught him had I seen him sooner &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I finished strongly and in a time of 35:20 gun time and 35:18 chip time shaving 1:05 off my previous PB.  Chuffed to bits about getting both a podium finish (got a trophy but no cash :-( ) and a huge new PB.

They sound perfect for running and if they really do protect against odors as they say they do, then the high cost will soon be offset by the fact I wouldn&#39;t need to buy a new one when the smell got too bad to tolerate as they wouldn&#39;t start smelling.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, last week I received an email with an offer I couldn&#39;t refuse. So I dug out my wallet and invested in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ashmei.com/shop/mens-performance-running-gear/details/247/7/mens/mens-short-sleeve-merino-+-carbon-jersey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ashmei Short Sleeve Merino + Carbon Jersey&lt;/a&gt; in red (no black ones in stock).

I&#39;ve only run 900km in them and I&#39;ve already worn through the fabric between the toes, which isn&#39;t ideal for an offroad shoe.  In my hunt for a new offroad shoe, I ventured back to VIVOBAREFOOT and got myself a pair of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vivobarefoot.com/uk/mens/off-road/breatho-trail-mens-2063.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Breatho Trails&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;VIVOBAREFOOT Breatho Trails&quot; src=&quot;/assets/breatho-trail.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;602&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve already got a pair of the older read and grey Breatho Trails which I use as a casual shoe so thought they&#39;d be great in the green and black to actually run in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On Saturday I took my new Breathos for a spin round &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reading parkrun&lt;/a&gt; for their first outing and they performed really well.  They did a great job of offering traction on the grass and gravel and offered good protection from the stones on the paths without taking too much away from the barefoot feel. I enjoyed running in them so much I got within 2 seconds of a PB without even realising it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All however was not rosy, and I only noticed this when I stopped running. The design of the shoe is a bit like a liner with an integrated tongue.  The part near the opening of the shoe are lovely and soft and really leads you to believe they&#39;d be great without socks.  However, this isn&#39;t the case. Deeper into the shoe, the nice soft lining stops and the stitching is exposed.  This rubbed the inside of my left arch a little and rubbed the metatarsal heads on both my big toes right through...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Breatho Blisters&quot; src=&quot;/assets/breatho-blisters.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Ugly feet blighted by rubbed raw blisters&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was only after I&#39;d leaked and hobbled my way home again - I ran to and from the parkrun as my warmup and cooldown - did I discover this was due to the exposed stitching.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, a great shoe and I&#39;ll definitely be running these into the ground, I just wish the lining completely covered all the internal stitching so I wouldn&#39;t have to wear socks when running in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">New Vivobarefoot Breatho Trails</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/new-vivobarefoot\"/>\n   <updated>2013-08-03T08:06:58+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/new-vivobarefoot</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Off to take my new @VIVOBAREFOOT Breatho Trails for a spin round @Readingparkrun.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Run on Barcelona Beach Front</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/run-on-barcelona-beach-front\"/>\n   <updated>2013-07-10T08:32:54+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/run-on-barcelona-beach-front</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Just had a great early morning run along Barcelona&#39;s beach front.

It&#39;s a cultural thing in South Africa and a bit of a tradition in my family.  Even if you aren&#39;t a runner, you know all about the Comrades Marathon and you will almost certainly haul yourself out of bed a little earlier to watch your fellow countrymen and women slog their guts out on the road between Durban and Pietermaritzburg.  You will almost certainly be back in front of the TV at the end of the day to watch the second most famous person, after the winner, in that year&#39;s race: the last person to cross the line before the 12 hour cut off.  It&#39;s a heartbreaking moment but gripping TV.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to the clip.  There&#39;s something about this clip that really strike a chord with me.  When I first heard it one crisp Sunday morning, it sent shivers through me; when it started, when Shoshaloza was sung, when the traditional cockrel crowed, when Chariots of Fire played and then when the gun went off and the announced announced the start of the race.  By the end of the little segment I was on the verge of tears with a great big lump in my throat and I was almost walking.  For some reason this little clip has had a profound impact on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/i-b7T3ppW/0/L/Simon_RunnersWorld-L.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Simon_RunnersWorld-S.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Simon Crossing the line at Two Oceans 2013&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;What a brilliant race photo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Guess what; today&#39;s run was interrupted by another one of these &quot;episodes&quot; when they played the exact clip again in this week&#39;s podcast (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marathontalk.com/podcast/episode_177_matt_briggs.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#177&lt;/a&gt;) and I decided I just had to share this with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Comrades is on my list of races to do and I WILL be doing it before I&#39;m 40; hopefully at least once in each direction.  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be able to run it enough times to get my permanent number, but we&#39;ll see, I&#39;m still young.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the topic of Comrades, good luck to everyone running it on Sunday.  I WILL be doing everything I can to locate a live stream I can watch from the UK.  A special good luck goes to my cousin who&#39;s gunning for a great time (Wally Haywood medal?) following his tremendous Silver medal (just dipping under 4 hours) and fantastic Runner&#39;s World and mantlepiece worthy photo in this year&#39;s Two Oceans.

Didn&#39;t get even close to sub-3 hours, let alone the 2:55 I had in mind. I was well on target until just before half-way when my right knee said &quot;Sorry boyks, no 2:55 for you today&quot;. Then with about 5km to go my calves very loudly told me &quot;You can write off the sub-3:15 too&quot;. In the end I hobbled round the stadium (it was quite embarrassing) and across the line in 124th place and a disappointing 3:22:50. So it looks like no London 2014 for me. All is not bad though, it&#39;s a PB by a whopping 49 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Update: 3:22:50 is my gun time. Chip time and ergo new PB is 3:22:40.

She&#39;s not a runner so in order to get her prepared for it we&#39;re following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cool Running Couch-to-5K programme&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a great little programme which slowly builds you to running a whole 5k which I think is perfect for my wife.  I also quite like to get to play coach and add in an additional run several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So a couple of weeks ago we set off and things started quite well. My wife is nowhere near as unfit as she thought, though she&#39;s also nowhere near fit enough to run a full 5k. As a result we&#39;ve actually been doing slightly more in terms of distance per session than the training programme suggests. Things were going well for the first week and a half and then she got one heck of a headcold and suspected ear infection so the running stopped.  We then picked things up again yesterday and had a nice gentle run.  Today we went out again and I thought I&#39;d be a little cheeky and change things slightly and see how she coped.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re meant to be doing the third day of week two: &lt;em&gt;Brisk five-minute warmup walk. Then alternate 90 seconds of jogging and two minutes of walking for a total of 20 minutes.&lt;/em&gt; but as yesterday went so well and as we&#39;ve been doing a bit more than the programme suggests (yesterday was 38mins of 90sec run, 2min walk), I upped the running intervals to two minutes each and kept the walking intervals at two minutes each.  I also cunningly devised a nice mostly offroad route that was just short of 5k.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I&#39;m pleased to say keeping the conversation going really helped and I think she noticed less of today&#39;s run than yesterday.  We got back home midway through a running interval so ran back and forth up and down the road until the last two minutes were up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The result: my wife walked/run 5k on the nose in a time of 43:35 without even knowing it and coped really well. I&#39;m chuffed she&#39;s finally hit the 5k mark.  Now she just needs to work on running the whole way and she&#39;ll breeze through her charity run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This afternoon&#39;s little saunter made a great little pre-race warm-up for tomorrow. I&#39;m feeling great and rested and am really looking forward to tomorrow&#39;s race... my first marathon in over 14 years.  The weather&#39;s looking good too so it should be a good day out.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Boston Magazine Tribute Cover</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/boston-magazine-tribute-cover\"/>\n   <updated>2013-04-27T11:31:14+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/boston-magazine-tribute-cover</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I think this is a fantastic and apt cover on the May edition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostonmagazine.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boston Magazine&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Boston Magazine Cover - May&quot; src=&quot;/assets/BostonMagazineCover.jpg&quot; width=&quot;570&quot; height=&quot;748&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2013/04/25/behind-our-may-boston-marathon-cover/&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We initially settled on the idea of commissioning Marathon-related essays from a number of Boston writers, and then set about brainstorming ideas for illustrating that package of stories. Should we create a photo illustration of a runner’s bib in the shape of a heart? Should we photograph a tattered marathon olive wreath on a black background? Then our design director, Brian Struble, and deputy design director, Liz Noftle, came up with the concept of taking shoes worn during the marathon and arranging them so that the negative space is in the shape of a heart. For reasons I’ll explain in a moment, I knew as soon as I heard the idea that we had our concept—not just for the collection of essays, but also for the cover. In fact, I quickly realized that the stories of the runners who wore those shoes would be even more powerful than the essays we’d commissioned. We quickly changed course and settled on the cover concept and the outlines of a feature package: We’d shoot the shoes collectively to form the heart, but we’d also photograph them as individual pairs to illustrate the stories told by the runners in the package (which we called “The Shoes We Wore,” and which you’ll find in the May issue).&lt;br /&gt;\n— &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2013/04/25/behind-our-may-boston-marathon-cover/&quot; title=&quot;Behind Our May Boston Marathon Cover&quot;&gt;Behind Our May Boston Marathon Cover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What a great idea and fitting tribute.

I finished, but not in a time worthy of screaming from the rooftops... 4:11 which is terrible when you consider my beautifully paced Two Oceans (56km) time of 4:48.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&#39;ve not raced anything further than 32km since, so I really don&#39;t have any recent marathon efforts to go on and thus I have to base my predictions on my performances over shorter distances.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nOne of the most popular formulas to use is Pete Riegel&#39;s formula (first published in Runner&#39;s World and still used in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/general/rws-race-time-predictor/1681.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this calculator&lt;/a&gt;)...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;t2 = t1 * (d2 / d1)&lt;sup&gt;1.06&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... where t1 is the given time, d1 is the given distance, d2 is the distance to predict a time for, and t2 is the calculated time for d2.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I won&#39;t explain the formula, you can read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://stathletics.tumblr.com/post/14931342638/riegels-equivalent-performance-formula&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I will say it is just a model.  A very good model, but not a 100% reliable and precise model.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if I take my best time for the distance closest to the marathon, the half-marathon at 1:19:53, and bung it into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/training-calculators-racetimes.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;calculator on Fetchpoint&lt;/a&gt; I get ...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table style=&quot;width: 250px; margin: 0 auto&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Dist&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Estimate&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Actual PB&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;5k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;17:22&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;17:36 &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot; id=&quot;1&quot; title=&quot;Offroad. No doubt it would be quicker on road.&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;10k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;36:12&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;37:55 &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot; id=&quot;2&quot; title=&quot;I actually ran 36:51 in the middle of the HM last year&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;10M&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;59:57&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;1:01:15&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;21.1k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;1:19:49&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;1:19:53 &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3&quot; id=&quot;3&quot; title=&quot;I suspect rounding is occurring here for ease of calculation of the other figures.&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;42.2k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;2:46:24&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;- - &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4&quot; id=&quot;4&quot; title=&quot;Left blank as I know my old PB means little today&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So if we take into account the notes, not a bad predictor for me, but look at the marathon time... 2:46!? Really!? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;OK, I&#39;ll let you into a secret, I discovered this earlier this year and it&#39;s been on my mind ever since. Now I&#39;ve not done much in the way of desired marathon paced training as I&#39;m testing to see if my success last season with MAF carries over to the marathon this year, however I have not been doing MAF exclusively. I&#39;ve also been doing one marathon specific speed session... &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/yasso-800s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yasso 800s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now the idea behind Yasso 800s is you do 800m intervals at the m:s time of your desired marathon&#39;s h:m time with 400m recovery between each. Each 400 is covered in the same amount of time as the 800s. Now the theory goes that it your regularly run 100+ km weeks and you can do 10 of these reps all at the desired pace, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;re in shape to run your marathon in your desired time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, yesterday I did my last Yasso 800s session and completed all 10 at my desired pace of approx 2:44-2:46/800m with 400m recovery in about 2:45 and I&#39;m chuffed to bits, however I&#39;m not confident about this 2:46 + &quot;a few minutes&quot; marathon I&#39;m supposed to be capable of. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;m in great form, but can I really do it?  It would be brilliant if I could and push it under 2:45 too as dipping under 2:45 means I can start the London Marathon with the elite men (I&#39;ll stand a long way behind Mo Farah &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;). That said, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll being finding out if I can on 6 May as I have one goal for this marathon: run sub-3:15 so I can qualify for next year&#39;s London Marathon by the &quot;Good for Age&quot; route.  I&#39;m actually gunning for sub-3 as I think I can do that, however I don&#39;t want to blow it gunning for an almost impossible time... 42.2km is a long way to run and get it horribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll certainly push things a bit if everything is going really well at the halfway mark. I think I&#39;ll leave the experimenting for the Abingdon Marathon in October.  Who knows, maybe I can get a 2:46-ish time then when I&#39;m a little more confident. &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Mo Does Half of VLM2013</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/mo-does-half-of-vlm2013\"/>\n   <updated>2013-04-21T11:06:10+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/mo-does-half-of-vlm2013</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;A little part of me is disappointed Mo Farah didn&#39;t shock the world and actually complete the #VLM2013.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Good Luck VLM2013 Runners</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/good-luck-vlm2013-runners\"/>\n   <updated>2013-04-21T09:06:01+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/good-luck-vlm2013-runners</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;What a lovely day for a marathon.

Next week will be my last 100k+ week before my marathon.  Think I may need to start considering an alternate shoe to race in too... the Vibram Seeyas keep giving me blisters between my some of my toes, but not all the time.  I&#39;m reluctant to change shoes as I love running in the Seeyas.  Might tape my toes for my marathon and then keep my eyes peeled for something just a light and minimal, but without the toe pockets.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Grizedale Duathlon</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/grizedale-duathlon\"/>\n   <updated>2013-03-26T10:16:46+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/grizedale-duathlon</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;On Sunday 10 March I took part in my first offroad duathlon, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highterrainevents.co.uk/2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Grizedale duathlon&lt;/a&gt; in the Grizedale Forest in the Lake District, and what an event it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Going to The Lakes just before Easter has become a bit of a habit for my wife and me.  It&#39;s normally a nice time to go as things are starting to get warmer, the signs of spring are starting to appear, all the sheep are starting to lamb and best of all, it&#39;s before the school holidays so it&#39;s cheaper and quieter.  One of the things we always do is go for a walk round Grizedale forest. There are loads of different paths and routes of varying technicality so there&#39;s always a walk or two to keep us entertained for a few hours. The last few times we&#39;ve been we&#39;ve noticed the remnants of the duathlon that would have taken place on the Sunday we arrived and each time I say that it would be nice to take part.  So this year that&#39;s precisely what we did.  We made sure we went up at the same time as the duathlon, which also happened to coincide with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hawksheadbrewery.co.uk/more_info_extra.asp?current_id=90&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hawkshead Brewery spring beer festival&lt;/a&gt;, and I entered the duathlon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWe arrived in Ambleside Saturday afternoon to some rather chilly weather and the beautiful sight of snow on the peaks. The forecast for the next day wasn&#39;t looking too rosy either with more snow overnight and wind and sleet on the cards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And that is exactly what we got... more snow and the wind blowing in over those snow covered peaks. As you can guess it was freezing on Sunday morning, but thankfully not raining.  Despite the cold, my wife, her parents and I wrapped up, strapped my bike to the car and headed over to Grizedale forest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once there, I unracked my bike and we walked up to the visitor centre to register and get ready for the race.  Following the compulsory pre-race briefing and a gentle warmup run, we were sent on our way for the first run, and what a run it was... almost straight up and then pretty much straight back down...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Run Profile&quot; src=&quot;/assets/run-elevation.png&quot; width=&quot;542&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Profile of the run route as recorded by my watch.&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The peak of the run is Carron Crag, the second highest point in Grizedale at a breath-taking height of 314 metres (1,030 ft) above sea-level.  Now getting up the hill the first time round was quite tough but enjoyable.  I took things relatively easy and enjoyed the run up and was quite pleased with the fact my Vibram Five Finger Spyridons seemed to be doing a brilliant job, however the same can&#39;t be said for the decent. The decent was much steeper than the ascent and very very rocky.  This is where the Vibrams weren&#39;t really the best things to be wearing.  Whilst I had to carefully place my feet, my fellow competitors wearing boots (by comparison) didn&#39;t seem to pay too much attention to where they planted their feet and went tearing down the hill.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once at the bottom, it was into the transition area.  This duathlon uses chipped based timing, but instead of using a strap round your ankle, you have a strap round your wrist with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportident.co.uk/equipment/shop/item.php?id=7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dibber&lt;/a&gt; that needed to be &quot;dipped&quot; into the stations at the entrance and exit of the transition area.  Prior to this event, I&#39;d always considered the transition area as a quick in-and-out area and quite important in the grand scheme of things.  This isn&#39;t the case on this duathlon as people didn&#39;t seem to be in any hurry to pass through the transition area whenever I was in there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; alt=&quot;Red Route Description&quot; src=&quot;/assets/red-route.png&quot; width=&quot;137&quot; height=&quot;135&quot; /&gt;Anyway, my first run went well and I completed it in 34:33 and spent 48 seconds in the transition area before heading off on the bike.  Straight away I knew this was going to be a tough ride.  The first 800m were on a wide gravel road, most of which we&#39;d just covered on the run, but then we took a sharp left turn onto a very narrow, very rocky and very steep path. I have now learnt this is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://visitlakelandforests.co.uk/index.php/component/ionfiles/?func=download&amp;fileid=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;North Face MTB trail&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) which has a &quot;Red Difficult&quot; rating.  The grading description on the right doesn&#39;t really convey how tough sections of this course are.  Take my word for it: it&#39;s tough, especially when mixing the single-track and very rocky paths with very steep climbs and descents mixed into a race environment. The cycle route didn&#39;t follow the entire North Face route, but most of it.  For me the best parts were the forest road sections... I&#39;m much more proficient on there sections.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As with the run, things were far from flat...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bike Profile&quot; src=&quot;/assets/cycle-elevation.png&quot; width=&quot;542&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Profile of the bike route as recorded by my watch.&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... and I found myself walking several sections as it was easier and considerably quicker than trying to cycle up the steep hills.  In fact, other than the forest road sections, this is the only time I overtook someone instead of being overtaken, and a lot of people overtook me &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; alt=&quot;timing slip &quot; src=&quot;/assets/timing-slip.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;576&quot; /&gt;Coupled with the incredibly tough riding conditions we got to experience some pretty tough weather conditions too.  Lots of strong winds and even snow flurries at the highest points of the ride contributed to making the race tough and I found myself shivering, despite being well wrapped up, in some of the windier sections.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At about 20km into the bike, I made the fatal mistake of thinking to myself: &quot;&lt;em&gt;You&#39;re doing well and you&#39;ve not fallen off&lt;/em&gt;&quot; and with that I instantly lost my grip with my right hand and took a drink from a very cold muddy puddle.  The last 4kms were just as tough as the earlier parts, but now I had ice-cold wet gloves and the very real fear of losing my grip again and eating a bit more dirt.  Thankfully that didn&#39;t happen and I managed to make it back to the transition area in a much slower than expected 1:52:06... I had expected to do the bike about 20-30 minutes quicker.  My second transition was much slower at 1:49 as I couldn&#39;t get my helmet off as my fingers were so numb I couldn&#39;t feel the clip.  Thankfully there were some people in the transition and I asked someone to undo my helmet for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All was not bad on the bike though... the views over Coniston Water were spectacular and incredibly beautiful with the the snow-covered peaks providing a lovely backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This second run was significantly more difficult than the first run.  My legs were incredibly tired from the bike and my quads started cramping every time I made any attempt to run uphill.  Running on the flat and downhill wasn&#39;t a problem, just the uphills.  As I couldn&#39;t actually do much running, I ended up walking a fair amount of the first half of the second run.  Normally I don&#39;t walk if I don&#39;t have to but I had no choice in the matter, my legs just wouldn&#39;t run without cramping.  I wasn&#39;t alone though, almost everyone around me on the second run were experiencing the same difficulties.  Naturally my second run time was significantly slower and I finished it in 45:19 giving me an overall time of 3:14:35.  I didn&#39;t have a goal time, but I had originally thought I&#39;d finish in less than 3 hours.  I readjusted my expectations part way through the cycle and decided on trying to get in under 3:15 which I managed to do, just.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://results.sportident.co.uk/home/event.html?eventid=8cdfffd4-0ec5-444c-9c2c-f1bc2ea5806a&amp;mobile=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official results&lt;/a&gt;, I finished in 86th place out of 157 finishers which isn&#39;t too bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, a great day out but definitely not an event I&#39;ll be doing on my own again... someone else can do the bike leg next time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d also like to say a great big huge thank-you to my mother-in-law for spending Mother&#39;s Day out in the cold watching me, my father-in-law for keeping my fans sane during the event and my wife for playing taxi after the event.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Cold World Cross-country Champs</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/cold-world-cross-country-champs\"/>\n   <updated>2013-03-24T12:21:06+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/cold-world-cross-country-champs</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;It looks a tad colder at the world cross-country champs in Poland than it was on my long run this morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Becoming the All-Terrain Human</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/becoming-the-all-terrain-human\"/>\n   <updated>2013-03-23T18:02:28+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/becoming-the-all-terrain-human</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;How&#39;s this for an introduction for an ultrarunner?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/magazine/creating-the-all-terrain-human.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kilian Jornet Burgada is the most dominating endurance athlete of his generation. In just eight years, Jornet has won more than 80 races, claimed some 16 titles and set at least a dozen speed records, many of them in distances that would require the rest of us to purchase an airplane ticket. He has run across entire landmasses­ (Corsica) and mountain ranges (the Pyrenees), nearly without pause. He regularly runs all day eating only wild berries and drinking only from streams. On summer mornings he will set off from his apartment door at the foot of Mont Blanc and run nearly two and a half vertical miles up to Europe’s roof — over cracked glaciers, past Gore-Tex’d climbers, into the thin air at 15,781 feet — and back home again in less than seven hours, a trip that mountaineers can spend days to complete. A few years ago Jornet ran the 165-mile Tahoe Rim Trail and stopped just twice to sleep on the ground for a total of about 90 minutes. In the middle of the night he took a wrong turn, which added perhaps six miles to his run. He still finished in 38 hours 32 minutes, beating the record of Tim Twietmeyer, a legend in the world of ultrarunning, by more than seven hours. When he reached the finish line, he looked as if he’d just won the local turkey trot.&lt;br /&gt;\n— &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/magazine/creating-the-all-terrain-human.html?_r=0&quot; title=&quot;Becoming the All-Terrain Human - NYTimes.com&quot;&gt;Becoming the All-Terrain Human - NYTimes.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Very good, and long article about a very impressive runner.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Wife Starting Running</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/wife-starting-running\"/>\n   <updated>2013-03-23T14:43:14+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/wife-starting-running</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;My wife took her first step towards becoming a runner today by buying a pair of Merrell Pace Glove minimalist running shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Strange Looks From Man Carrying a Brick</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/strange-looks-from-man-carrying-a-brick\"/>\n   <updated>2013-03-20T15:07:46+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/strange-looks-from-man-carrying-a-brick</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I got some strange looks on my run today (for my Vibrams) from a man running with a brick in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Moonboots</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/moonboots\"/>\n   <updated>2013-03-19T16:06:24+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/moonboots</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Check out these bad boys...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;HokaOneOne.jpg&quot; src=&quot;/assets/HokaOneOne.jpg&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Lightweight Moonboots?&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I thought these were a spoof when I first saw the image, but it appears they&#39;re a genuine product and the pair in the picture is trail shoe!?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hokaoneone.eu/en/technology.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; in these shoes is impressive, in particular the explanation for the huuuuuuge drop...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 2.5x the volume of EVA in the midsole compared to standard running shoes.

I digress.&lt;br /&gt;\nWhen you started using the MAF principle; did you experience your heart rate monitor pinging off before you even felt you where actually getting into your stride?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have tried this for a month now (and even though you suggest trying for 3 months at least) I am finding it utterly soul destroying. I feel like it want to rip the HRM off and smash it to smithereens because it must be lying to me, constantly pinging saying heart rate too high, I am barely moving.&lt;br /&gt;\nI have read Dr Mafftones Big book of endurance and this situation is often referenced, people can seemingly run happily a lot faster than they can slower. Driving me nuts.&lt;br /&gt;\nJust wondering if you had to go through this phase or your aerobic capacity was already sufficient to operate at a low HR?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The only thing that stops me throwing the HRM in the next brook is, it works fine when out on the bike. Can keep the HR nicely at may max level of 135bpm.&lt;br /&gt;\nI can only conclude. Running is far more taxing than cycling, my aerobic capacity or running economy is shockingly poor or both.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Any words of wisdom would be much appreciated. Failing that, the simple cold truth, is my own conclusion about right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jason the dis heartend&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t feel dis-heartened, you&#39;re not alone.  This is actually a very common issue and I did indeed experience the same frustration as you are experiencing.  My body used to be primed for fast training and I could and would whiz through training sessions at significantly higher heart rates. This however isn&#39;t very good for MAF and I had to be patient.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nOne suggestion you might like to try is adding 5 or 10 BPM to your MAF limit and try that for a few weeks to a month, then slowly start decreasing back down to your calculated MAF value.  A colleague experienced the same issue as you and found this worked really well for him.  He didn&#39;t drop back to his calculated MAF HR in the end though, but he is an older athlete (the MAF calc starts to become a bit sketchy in older trained athletes) and his new calculated HR was significantly lower than he&#39;d been training at before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, I effectively did this myself without even realising it as I spent a few months before completely switching to MAF following some of the ideas of &quot;Hadd&#39;s Approach to Distance Training&quot; as mentioned and referenced in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/does-maf-training-work&quot;&gt;Does Maximum Aerobic Function (MAF) Training Work?&lt;/a&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once your body gets used to running at such a low HR, you&#39;ll find you will still get days like this when you feel like you&#39;re not moving and your HRM just won&#39;t stop beeping.  Generally these indicate you&#39;re going a lot quicker than you really think you are (everyone loves to feel on top of the world), you&#39;re running in tougher climatic conditions (wind, heat and cold do crazy things with the HR), you&#39;re tired, or your body may not be 100% and could be giving you an early indication of either over-training or a pending cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On these days I try to slow my pace and lower my HR whilst taking into account all of these factors.  If I still can&#39;t get my HR down and can&#39;t explain the elevation, I cut my run short and head for the showers.  My body is probably telling me something and ignoring it will just annoy me and possibly lead to injury or illness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So in summary, don&#39;t feel disheartened and don&#39;t give in just yet. It&#39;s perfectly normal.

Are you absolutely sure about that?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Very little has been said about this…..On December 2, Basque athlete Iván Fernández Anaya was competing in a cross-country race in Burlada, Navarre. He was running second, some distance behind race leader Abel Mutai - bronze medalist in the 3,000-meter steeplechase at the London Olympics. As they entered the finishing straight, he saw the Kenyan runner - the certain winner of the race - mistakenly pull up about 10 meters before the finish, thinking he had already crossed the line.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fernández Anaya quickly caught up with him, but instead of exploiting Mutai&#39;s mistake to speed past and claim an unlikely victory, he stayed behind and, using gestures, guided the Kenyan to the line and let him cross first.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ivan Fernandez Anaya, a Basque runner of 24 years who is considered an athlete with a big future (champion of Spain of 5,000 meters in promise category two years ago) said after the test:&lt;br /&gt;\n&amp;quot;But even if they had told me that winning would have earned me a place in the Spanish team for the European championships, I wouldn&#39;t have done it either. I also think that I have earned more of a name having done what I did than if I had won. And that is very important, because today, with the way things are in all circles, in soccer, in society, in politics, where it seems anything goes, a gesture of honesty goes down well.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He said at the beginning: unfortunately, very little has been said of the gesture. And it&#39;s a shame. In my opinion, it would be nice to explain to children, so they do not think that sport is only what they see on TV: violent kicks in abundance, posh statements, fingers in the eyes of the enemy ...&lt;br /&gt;\n— &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=456447927743095&amp;amp;set=a.326047560783133.83173.325981127456443&amp;amp;type=1&quot; title=&quot;Is Winning All That Counts?

With that done, I think it&#39;s a good time to sum up my running for 2012.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So what happened in 2012 in my little running world?  Well, lots.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Training&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started the year by switching my training to follow the maximum aerobic function (MAF) theory and method devised by Phil Maffetone (see my post &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/does-maf-training-work&quot;&gt;Does Maximum Aerobic Function (MAF) Training Work?&lt;/a&gt; post from Saturday for more details) and experienced tremendous returns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I was running all of my training aerobically, I found I was recovering incredibly quickly and soon found I could run for an hour or more many days on the trot, including after a 2-to-3 hour long run on a Sunday.  As a result my mileage climbed to levels I&#39;ve never run before...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;training_2012.png&quot; src=&quot;/assets/training_2012.png&quot; width=&quot;610&quot; height=&quot;111&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Monthly training totals for 2009 - 2012 (all figures are in kilometers)&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, every month trumped the years before with 3 huge months: June, August and November, each over 300km.  I&#39;m not quite sure what happened in February and March as I didn&#39;t log the days I didn&#39;t run (that&#39;ll be changing next year), didn&#39;t document any complaints in my logs and didn&#39;t post any blog posts to suggest a problem.  I know I had a holiday in the lake district and I tapered (unnecessary in hindsight) for &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-reading-half-marathon-2012&quot;&gt;my first half-marathon in over 13 years&lt;/a&gt; in March, but that shouldn&#39;t have entirely accounted for such a poor showing in March.  February we can probably blame on the weather - I&#39;ve become much less of a fair-weather runner through the year &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within all this training are 5 weeks in which I covered more than 100km in each week with my biggest week being the week of 3 - 9 September when I clocked in 121.54km. Impressed?  I am &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; and I&#39;m chuffed to bits with the fact 8 of the 12 months have totals over 200km and the total of 2823km for the year.  This is 823km MORE than I thought I&#39;d cover when I set myself a target of 2000km for the year in January 2012.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So given the success I&#39;ve had so far with this training, more on the effects on my racing coming up, I&#39;m going to be sticking with this MAF training for a lot longer.  As I mentioned in Saturday&#39;s post, the only change I&#39;ll be introducing this year is a race-specific speed session once a fortnight.  I also plan to introduce a bit more strength work in the form of hills and full body weight sessions (got to get my money&#39;s worth in the gym) to the non-peak-racing parts of the year. Both will be closely monitored to see if they have a negative impact on my overall training and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After reading Phil Maffetone&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1616080655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Big Book of Endurance&lt;/a&gt;, I started to consider the merits of a lower carbohydrate diet.  I then read Tim Noakes&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1770221468/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Challenging Beliefs&lt;/a&gt; and I was convinced this was something I had to try and put to the test so I adopted a &quot;paleo-lite&quot; diet as I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/training-and-diet-update&quot;&gt;mid-year update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After experiencing some very good results, I finally took the plunge and dropped the carbs almost entirely.  No more pre-long run or pre-race carbs (I was still consuming some &quot;complex carbs&quot; until about June); just good ol&#39; fat and protein and lots of it and I&#39;ve not looked back and I don&#39;t think I will.  Thus far I&#39;ve not needed a stack of carbs before any of my runs and in fact I believe I now perform better by NOT having any carbs before I race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So with a good 6 months of a low-carb, high-fat (LCHF) diet I can say this works for me as...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I have lost weight without even trying.  You may say performing the MAF training would have done this, and you&#39;re probably right, but only partly.  Once I switched to a LCHF diet, the weight just fell off.  I started the year weighing 81kg and soon stabilised at 79kg.  I&#39;m ending the year weighing 71kg with the biggest drop in their weight coming after I switched completely to the LCHF diet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I noticed my endurance improved significantly.  Once again, the MAF would have contributed to this, but I think switching to the LCHF helped even more as fat is definitely a better fuel source for me than carbohydrates.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I experienced much better and more consistent energy levels.  I&#39;m a lively chap most of the time, but I always found I had a slump around about 3pm each afternoon when I craved a choccy or some other quickfix carb snack - my will power was good so I very rarely gave in, but I still experienced the sugar low.  Things were particularly bad on the weekend when I tended not to have my mid-morning apple or banana.  I&#39;d then enter the state my wife and I call &quot;hangry&quot;.  It&#39;s when I&#39;d get grumpy, snappy and agitated because of low sugar levels.  Not anymore.  I can breeze through the afternoon or Saturday morning&#39;s shopping without even noticing the time or feeling the slightest bit peckish.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, my wife has switched to a LCHF diet with me, though with a bit less stringenc, and she too is reaping the benefits, except the running part - she&#39;s not a runner.  She does however miss the likes of bread (she&#39;s a huge marmite fan) and pasta more than me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So as with the MAF training, this is something else I&#39;ll be keeping up and I definitely encourage you to consider it too.  If anything, get hold of a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1609611543/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wheat Belly&lt;/a&gt; and try giving up just wheat to start with and see the benefits.  The rest of the carbs will soon follow &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Racing&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So you now know about my diet and training, what happened in the racing?  Well check out these times:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table style=&quot;width:100%&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Dist&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;2011 Season Best&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;2012 Season Best&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Improvement&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;5km (off-road)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;19:06&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;17:36&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1:30&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;5mile (off-road)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;32:03&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;30:55&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1:08&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;10km&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;39:42&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;37:55&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1:58&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;21.km&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1:29:52*&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1:19:53&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;10:01&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;* The 2011 season half-marathon was actually run in April 2012 but as I didn&#39;t run a half-marathon last year, I&#39;ve included it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The 5k off-road and half-marathon are all-time personal bests according to my records.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve run 5km on-road quicker, but not off-road.  I&#39;d also never run a half-marathon anywhere near 1h 20m before, let alone run under it and best of all, &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/should-i-be-running-a-10k-pb-in-a-half-marathon&quot;&gt;that half-marathon included a 10k PB&lt;/a&gt;. I can&#39;t wait for a nice fast 10k in 2013 to see if I can get a new all-time PB.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I can only put these great times down to the fantastic aerobic base the MAF training has given me and the adaptation of my body to a LCHF diet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am now running at a quicker pace than I was when I left South Africa at the ripe old age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Plans for 2013&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With 2012 behind me and 2013 looming on the horizon, it&#39;s time to think about my goals for next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My first and probably biggest goal is to run a sub-3 hour marathon at the Milton Keynes marathon in May and thus qualify for the 2014 London Marathon well within the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virginlondonmarathon.com/marathon-centre/enter-virgin-london-marathon/good-for-age-entries/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Good for age&quot; limit of 3:10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once that&#39;s out of the way I think I&#39;ll have a good go at the following goals...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;sub-17 5k&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;sub-36 10k&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;sub-78 1/2 marathon&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;run a 100km week at least once a month&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;exceed 3200km of running for the year - this isn&#39;t too important as I tend to train by time rather distance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think these are good attainable goals which are going to be tough to hit, but with some good training I think I might be able to accomplish them.  I&#39;m also going to start logging the days when I don&#39;t run so I can understand the fluctuations in monthly totals and gauge the effects of my training more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m really enjoying my running at the moment and really hope next year is another bumper year.

Slow Down&#39;&quot;&gt;maximum aerobic function (MAF) training by Phil Maffetone&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).  It seemed like an incredibly simplistic approach and I was a little skeptical about the efficacy of such a &quot;slow&quot; approach to running so I threw the question out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a lot of research and some good feedback from others I took a whole-hearted plunge into the world of MAF training on 23 January this year.  I didn&#39;t take the plunge sooner as I was still very concerned about the incredibly slow pace I&#39;d be training at and instead opted to finish out 2011 and most of January 2012 mixing up times and heart rate ranges using some of the ideas garnered from a huge article by John Hadd Walsh known as &quot;&lt;a title=&quot;A local copy for prosperity&quot; href=&quot;/assets/hadd.pdf&quot;&gt;Hadd’s Approach to Distance Training&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (PDF).  This served me well and I was soon building a good aerobic base and clocking up monthly totals I&#39;d not seen before: October 2011: 216km and November 2011: 252km.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I said, this served me well, but there was still this niggle in the back of mind: &quot;What would happen if I trained to the ideas of MAF?&quot;  Some of my training runs had been pretty close to my calculated MAF range so I&#39;d started to get used to the slower training pace. So I bought Phil&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1616080655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1616080655&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;big yellow book&lt;/a&gt;, read it, put my pride in my pocket and dived right in.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nNow for a quick recap.  The idea behind MAF is you perform all your training until you stop seeing improvements, under a heart rate calculated by subtracting your age from 180 and then adding or subtracting a few beats depending on experience, age, injury and general health.  My calculation was: &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;180 - 32&lt;/code&gt; (my age)&lt;code&gt; + 5&lt;/code&gt; (I&#39;m experienced)&lt;code&gt; = 153 BPM&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those who know me will know I&#39;m actually 33, and have been for the entire time I&#39;ve been whole-heartedly committed to MAF training this year, so I&#39;m not entirely sure why I chose 32 when performing the calculation.  I can only think I did the calculation sometime last year and didn&#39;t think to reduce it by one after my birthday.  That said, I doubt 1 BPM really made that much of a difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I then took 5 off that figure to set a lower heart rate and thus setup a range of 148 - 153 BPM.  Now this isn&#39;t part of MAF.  If I recall correctly, there is no mention of a lower heart rate to keep above, however I decided I&#39;d like a lower heart rate to try and keep all my training within a set range.  This would allow me to easily judge how my general well-being, health, mood and the weather affected my training. All warm ups and cool downs were performed at a heart rate lower than 148 BPM.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After an initial test on 13 September, I decided on a simple traffic-free flat 10km out-and-back (5k each way) route along the Thames as my test route (instead of chugging round a track until I got dizzy) and 30 January 2011 I performed my first MAF test for the year. It wasn&#39;t too bad, but wasn&#39;t brilliant.  Every kilometer, except the first, took over 5 mins to cover.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With my initial test out of the way, I set to doing all of my training in the 148-153 BPM heart range and as I did so I increased the time I ran.  Soon I was easily running over an hour a day, every day, without feeling tired. I felt like I&#39;d been for a run, but I wasn&#39;t knackered and breathing heavily at the end of it.  I really started to enjoy my running again and re-introduced the Sunday long run too.  These were done slightly differently in that I ran the first hour with my heart rate below 148 BPM and then the rest in my MAF range. This proved to be a great idea as I felt great after each long run and could easily head out for an hour on the Monday morning, which I normally do.  As a result my mileage climbed to new highs and my race times came tumbling down.  More on both of those coming in a post next week when I summarize the year&#39;s running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I persisted with the MAF training with absolutely no traditional speed work in my training.  The closest I got to speed work was road races and parkruns.  I tried to get some sort of consistency with performing the MAF tests to track my progress, but wasn&#39;t 100% successful on this as things like the weather and work stresses really affect the times so I had to skip a few or move them to later dates, but I still managed to get some in.  As the year progressed it soon became very clear that the MAF training was having a huge effect on my performance and I we definitely becoming a faster and more efficient runner by running slower.  Have a look at this....&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/MAF_test_results_graph_2012.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;MAF Test Results Graph 2012&quot; src=&quot;/assets/MAF_test_results_graph_2012.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, bar a few anomalies (due to weather, stress etc), almost every MAF test showed an improvement with a huge leap between the May and July tests which I think can be attributed to re-introducing my Sunday long runs and a more concerted effort to follow a low-carb, high-fat diet (LCHF).  Interestingly the last 3 MAF tests had all but the last kilometer covered under 5:00/km. I&#39;ve not had a chance to do another test this year as mother nature has decided the Thames isn&#39;t wide enough around Reading and really needs the path I run on too &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I can conclusively say...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;font-weight: bold; font-size:25px&quot;&gt;Yes, maximum aerobic function (MAF) training DOES work&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... and it works very very well, and best of all, I went into every race feeling fresh without doing any tapering what-so-ever.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So why does it work?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I think it&#39;s a combination of things...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1.  It forces you to go right back to basics and run long and slow and consistently.  Every good coach will tell you about the importance of building a good aerobic base, but very few emphasize this enough.  What&#39;s more the likes of Runner&#39;s World don&#39;t make it any easier as &quot;go out and run slowly and longer to get faster&quot; really doesn&#39;t sell magazines, not that anyone would believe the article anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2.  It is at a sufficiently slow speed that it is entirely aerobic and as a result it forces you to become more of a fat-burning machine than a carb-burning machine.  With my switch to a LCHF diet, I&#39;ve found burning fat to be a far superior source of fuel than carbohydrates and performing MAF shorter runs (less than 2.5 hours) on an empty stomach was hardly an effort. Long runs definitely needed a little bit of a LCHF breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So am I finished with MAF?  Not on your nelly.  I plan to continue with almost all of my training runs in future being within my MAF range.  I will however be introducing a change next year.  I think I now have quite a big aerobic base - it&#39;s nowhere near that of the elite and top club runners, but a heck of a lot closer than it used to be - so I&#39;m going to start introducing one fortnightly race-specific training session that really taxes me and trains my body for the race ahead.  I can&#39;t say I felt the need for any race-specific training last year, but given my times continued to improve through the year as I trained and raced more, I think it&#39;s worth a try.  Worst case scenario: I find they start to have a negative impact and I&#39;ll either reduce the frequency or drop them entirely.  One thing is for sure: the MAF training and the Sunday long runs will not be going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So if I have one bit of advice for runner it is to take some time out, read Phil Maffetone&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/Want_Speed_Slow_Down_2007.pdf&quot; title=&quot;A local copy of &#39;Want Speed? Slow Down&#39;&quot;&gt;Want Speed? Slow Down&lt;/a&gt; PDF and give the MAF method of training a go. It really works.  Try it exclusively for 3 months and see what happens to your running.  You&#39;ll be very surprised.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Merry Christmas 2012</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/merry-christmas-2012\"/>\n   <updated>2012-12-25T09:00:00+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/merry-christmas-2012</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Merry Christmas&quot; src=&quot;/assets/christmas.jpg&quot; width=&quot;620&quot; height=&quot;465&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Mid-run Ditch-water Shower</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/mid-run-ditch-water-shower\"/>\n   <updated>2012-12-24T14:07:17+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/mid-run-ditch-water-shower</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;A very merry f***ing Christmas goes out to the white van driver who thought I needed a ditch-water shower right in the middle of my run along the A4 outside Twyford today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You made absolutely no attempt to slow down or avoid the huge puddle.

They cost me about $140, which at the time worked out to about £88.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/vibram-five-finger-seeya&quot;&gt;Vibram Five Finger Seeyas&lt;/a&gt; to replace the Bikilas.  I&#39;ve now run 130km in the Seeyas and I think they&#39;ve bedded in well so I can now officially retire the Bikilas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the last 19 months I&#39;ve officially logged 1865km to the Bikilas. I&#39;ve run a lot more than that if we take into account warm-ups and cooldowns I&#39;ve not logged and of course walking around before and after runs and races, but as they&#39;re not officially logged, we&#39;ll ignore those additional kilometers and work with what I know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So what do a pair of Bilikas look like after 1865km? Pretty good, if you ignore these little annoyances...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Camera-Awesome-Photos/i-NxMn7CQ/0/L/CA_11151214591050-L.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/CA_11151214591050-S.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I can see daylight (1)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Camera-Awesome-Photos/i-cVKcSMd/0/L/CA_11151214591774-L.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/CA_11151214591774-S.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;I can see daylight (2)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;I can see daylight&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... and only concentrate on the rest of the shoe ...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/CA_11151214580409-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vibram Five Finger Bikilas after 1865km (1)&quot; /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/CA_11151214581261-M.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ibram Five Finger Bikilas after 1865km (2)&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Vibram Five Finger Bikilas after 1865km&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Other than the holes and dirt (I&#39;ve not bothered washing them this close to retirement), they look pretty good. To be honest, the holes in the toes weren&#39;t causing me any bother though so I could easily have kept running in them until I wore through the ball of the foot, though that wouldn&#39;t be for much longer as the balls are very thin now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So as you can see, they&#39;ve held up pretty well, and I&#39;m certainly impressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&#39;ve titled this post &quot;Vibram Five Finger Bikilas are Very Cheap&quot; and they are... on a pence-per-kilometer scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1865km for £88 works out at 4.72 pence a kilometer.  That is incredibly cheap, especially when you consider most people retire their £80 shoes at about 500km (at a cost of 16p a kilometer) on the guidance of the their local running shop and publications like Runner&#39;s World. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So whilst I was reluctant to spend the money at first, I&#39;m glad I did.  I&#39;ve had a great time running in the Vibram Five Finger Bikilas and am so far loving the Seeyas and Spyridons I&#39;ve just got.  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll get quite as many kilometers on the Seeyas as they&#39;re much less of a shoe than the Bikilas, but I anticipate I&#39;ll get at least the same on the Spyridons. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Quick Turnaround From Garmin</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/quick-turnaround-from-garmin\"/>\n   <updated>2012-11-28T10:59:51+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/quick-turnaround-from-garmin</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Wow that was quick.

After a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/new-garmin-or-refurb&quot;&gt;umming and aaahhhing about whether I should go the refurb route or buy a different watch&lt;/a&gt; (I thought about the Garmin Forerunner 610), I&#39;ve decided to go for the refurb.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;ll cost £78.30 vs £224 for a new Forerunner 610.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this watch I&#39;m sending back is a refurb replacement for this exact issue I experienced around about this time last year.  I think I&#39;m spotting a pattern here: the watch (either new or refurb) seems to develop a battery fault with about a year of constant use:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I purchased my original Garmin Forerunner 405CX on 26 January 2010.&lt;br /&gt;\nI contacted Garmin about the watch no longer holding charge on 12 January 2011.

Hopefully I don&#39;t have to write a similar post in 12-14 months from now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Holding thumbs the refurb will be with me before I head off to sunny South Africa for my holibobs, I&#39;m not holding my breath though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I&#39;ve just realised there is no pattern.

I worked out I&#39;d probably cover about 33-35km in that time.  I ended up covering just over 35km in 2 hours and 57 minutes - I&#39;d already tacked on a run round the block as I got back home way quicker than I anticipated, so didn&#39;t push things to get the final 3 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was a lovely run.  Not a cloud in the sky and thankfully very little traffic on the country roads I was running on.  One thing is for sure: I definitely over dressed for this run.  It was 2C when I left, so I dressed for it, only to find that the sun was very warming and I soon warmed up meaning I ended up running most of my run with the outer jacket wrapped round my waist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s run also took this week&#39;s &quot;kilometer-age&quot; over 100km.  My 5th 100km week of the year, and probably my last for the year.  I however plan to get in a lot more of these big weeks next year - I&#39;m thinking at least one a month.  We&#39;ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the sun is still shining, I have tired legs, so I think I&#39;ll spend the rest of the day on my bum drinking beer (after we&#39;ve popped to Sainsbury&#39;s for a little top-up grocery shop). Wonder if I can convince the Mrs to take me to the pub whilst we&#39;re out &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Vibram Five Fingers Seeya</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vibram-five-finger-seeya\"/>\n   <updated>2012-11-05T09:39:58+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vibram-five-finger-seeya</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;The posty came to see me again today to drop off my newest order...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/aa64b3ec272c11e298dc22000a1fc2d3_7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vibram Five Finger Seeya&quot; width=&quot;612&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Vibram Five Finger Seeya&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let me hear you all say &quot;Ooooooo&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These will now be my primary road shoe, though I think I might rotate them with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/vibram-five-fingers-spyridon&quot;&gt;Spyridons&lt;/a&gt;.

It is tipping it down outside and it&#39;s cold. Normally I don&#39;t mind the rain and gauge if it&#39;s worth heading out by how hard it is raining and how wet I&#39;m likely to be at the end of my run. This morning I woke up to find it tipping down and worked out that I&#39;d be about 15 mins into my 2 hour run before I&#39;d have wet undies. No thanks. An hour and three quarters of training with soggy jocks is not my idea of fun and enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Think I&#39;ll wait until later in the day to see if it eases up.

When hunting around, I discovered the Maidenhead half, which seemed to tick all the boxes: it was flat, close to home, a half-marathon, 5 months after my last half, no clashes with other races and in an area I&#39;m familiar with.  So I entered the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now when I originally entered this race, the details of the route were unclear and I was under the impression they&#39;d use the same route as they did in 2011.  This wasn&#39;t the case and as we got closer to the event, I discovered the new route was a multi-lap race rather than the single lap route they used in 2011.  I&#39;m not a fan of multi-lap races, especially longer races, as I get a bit bored and a bit demotivated on the subsequent laps - I think I perform much better when I don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming.  But as I&#39;d already entered and you can&#39;t get refunds, I went ahead and ran it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Going into the race I had the idea of attempting to run it in about 80 mins.  According to my WAVA score for my other distances, this should be possible, especially as most of my training has been concentrating on longer runs.  So that&#39;s what I had in my mind as a goal for the race, though it wasn&#39;t a concrete goal as I&#39;d never gone that fast over 21.1km before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Race day came and it was a little on the cold side.  This is a good sign.  I definitely run quicker when it&#39;s cooler. My wife drove me to the race as she needed to take her dad to hospital, so we parked in the Sainsbury&#39;s carpark and headed to the town hall outside which the race was starting and finishing.  After a little milling around I soon worked out where the baggage drop-off point was, stripped down, queued (for a long time) and deposited my bag.  Due to the queue to hand in my bag I ended up having to cut my warm up short so managed to only squeeze in a 7 min warm up before making my way to the sub-90 min &quot;pen&quot;.  There weren&#39;t actual pens, but there were signs to give you an idea of where you should start in the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Maidenhead half-marathon 2012 route&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Maidenhead_half_route.png&quot; width=&quot;321&quot; height=&quot;422&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Maidenhead Half-marathon 2012 route&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At 9:30am we were sent on our way by Paralympic gold medalist &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Christiansen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sophie Christiansen&lt;/a&gt; (who now has a gold postbox on Maidenhead high street outside HSBC) and into the first bottle-neck of the race: the start/finish line.  The area behind the start of the race was the complete width of the street.  The start/finish line was not, so the moment the gun went off, everyone was funneled into a smaller gap in order to cross the start line.  As I was close to the front, there was only a little bit of elbowing, but I imagine it was terrible further back.  In less than 200m we were thrown onto the High Street with a sharp left.  Once again, it was a bit of a jostle and probably a bit of argy-bargy happening further back in the field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a quick loop round town, it was down past Waitrose and under the A4/Bridge Road using the pedestrian/cycle underpass.  Great idea I thought when I learnt of the route - &quot;this way they don&#39;t need to stop traffic on the A4&quot;.  However when I entered the underpass I realised this probably wasn&#39;t the best idea after all as Britain&#39;s underpasses have these lovely &quot;anti-cyclist&quot; barriers.  Essentially metal railings set staggered across the path on the ramps into and out of  the underpass that force cyclists to slow down. No problems for me as the field had thinned out nicely by the time I got to the underpass but definitely a problem when the masses come through.  These barriers would force everyone into single-file to zig-zag through them.  What&#39;s more, there was no warning these were coming so if you turned sharply out of the tunnel, you&#39;d run straight into the barriers.  You&#39;d have thought they&#39;d remove these knowing 2500-odd people would be streaming through this first tunnel within minutes of the race starting, but they didn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once we&#39;d negotiated the underpass and its barriers we had a little meander through the Ray Mead/Park before we joined Ray Mead road and headed for Cookham.  On entering Cookham, we cut up School Lane, joined the High Street, turned left into Maidenhead Road, followed this all the way back towards Maidenhead, turned left into Ray Mill Road West which then became Ray Mill Road East before joining Ray Mead Road again for the second lap.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I was sort of aiming for around 80 minutes, I set off at a good pace of around 3:46 to 3:48 a km and was chugging along beautifully with very little variation in pace.  Until about 14km, which is now well into the second lap, when I a) started to get a bit bored and b) I started to over-think things.  I was still feeling strong at 14km and was going well, but doubt crept into my mind.  I&#39;d never run this fast over 21.1km.  I&#39;d also not raced this far on a low-carb, high-fat diet and I started to think about the things that could go wrong like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_the_wall&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dreaded wall&lt;/a&gt; to making its appearance.  So as a result I slowed down to about 4:00 a km and settled in for this slightly slower pace waiting for something to go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With just over a kilometer to go, we turned into Kidwells Park for a loop round the back before using another underpass to go back under the A4 and join the high street and it was about here that I realised nothing was going to go wrong.  The wall wasn&#39;t going to make an appearance and I was on my way to a personal best for the half-marathon.  It wouldn&#39;t be under 80 mins, but it would certainly be a PB by about 5 mins, so I picked up the pace and flew to the finish, evening finding plenty of energy to out-sprint a chap on the last 100m to the finish line (&lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.sussexsportphotography.com/viewpicture.tlx?pictureid=12819442959&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;check this pic of me flying&lt;/a&gt;) in a gun time of 1:21:46.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During our run, the start area had been transformed into the finish area with tables setup containing cups of water and  probably the best thing I&#39;ve seen at the end of a race in a long time: boxes and boxes of perfectly ripe bananas.  What a brilliant idea, especially for a &lt;abbr title=&quot;low-carb, high-fat&quot;&gt;LCHF&lt;/abbr&gt; runner like me who is only going to reject, throw away or give away the usual sugary post-race choccie or &quot;sports bar&quot; often handed out at the end of races.   Note to other race organisers: get bananas, and lots of them &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, this is a good fast and very well organised race with some room for improvement, most notably the baggage drop-off and pick-up needs to be setup such that multiple queues can be used to drop-off and then pick-up the bags and something could be done to reduce the bottlenecks, barriers and sharp turns the underpasses introduce to the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepatchrunning.com/images/stories/purplepatchrunning/Races/PMHMResultsforweb2012v5.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official results&lt;/a&gt; were:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gun time: 1:21:46&lt;br /&gt;\nChip time: 1:21:40&lt;br /&gt;\nPosition: 47 / 1829&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Merrell Trail Gloves Again or Inov-8 Trailroc 235s</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/merrell-trail-gloves-again-or-inov-8-trailroc-235s\"/>\n   <updated>2012-10-25T11:44:14+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/merrell-trail-gloves-again-or-inov-8-trailroc-235s</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s time to get a new pair of offroad shoes and I&#39;m undecided as to whether I should stick with the Merrell Trail Gloves or try something new and go for the Inov-8 Trailroc 235s.

It was a clear crisp morning with loads of potential for a good time. I headed off probably a little fast (I went through 10k one second quicker than my all-time 10k PB) in an attempt to get a sub-80min half marathon. I knew I was capable of it, I just wanted to do it this season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- more --&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things went really well and my faster start meant I wasn&amp;#39;t too far off target after slowing due to the hills and sharp corners towards the end of the race. I still needed to sprint at the end to dip in under 80mins gun time, but that&amp;#39;s a small price to pay for a fab race and a new all-time PB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is only the second running of this race, so it can be forgiven for not quite getting everything right.  Whilst everything went well for me, I did spot several places for improvement:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; The baggage drop-off and pickup needs to be able to accommodate more than one queue.  It also needs to process people&amp;#39;s bags a lot quicker.  With 30mins to go to the start the queue was snaking all over the carpark and I calculated it would take at least 15-20mins for me to hand in my bag had I joined the queue, leaving me with very little time to warmup and get to the start.  Instead I opted to run the 5 mins back to my car and drop my back off there.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Don&amp;#39;t funnel everyone the moment you cross the start line.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Use flatter timing &amp;quot;mats&amp;quot;.  The timing ridges are very sudden and quite high. I didn&amp;#39;t experience too much of a problem as I knew what to expect before the start so I was actively looking out for a 3-5cm step, but given the start became very cramped due to the funneling, I&amp;#39;m sure many a person behind me tripped over or stumbled over the timing &amp;quot;ridges&amp;quot;.  The same thing applies to the finish straight.  Right when you legs are knackered, the last thing you want to do is hop, skip and jump over 3 hurdles on the finishing straight.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.racetimingsystems.com/public/result.aspx?raceid=2116&amp;amp;bib=590&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;\nGun time: 1:19:58&lt;br&gt;\nChip time: 1:19:53&lt;br&gt;\nPosition: 29 / 3032&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Should I be Running a 10k PB In a Half-Marathon?</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/should-i-be-running-a-10k-pb-in-a-half-marathon\"/>\n   <updated>2012-10-15T10:35:30+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/should-i-be-running-a-10k-pb-in-a-half-marathon</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I ran the Oxford Half-marathon and set a new all-time personal best (PB) for the half-marathon (more details coming in a later post) and I was just in the process of reviewing my &lt;a href=&quot;http://connect.garmin.com/activity/233229988&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;watch data&lt;/a&gt; when I noticed the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;10k PB in a Half-marathon&quot; src=&quot;/assets/10k_pb_in_21k.png&quot; width=&quot;260&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;I went through the 10k mark 1 second ahead of my all-time 10k PB time&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That folks is an all time PB for 10km for me, by one second, and it has occurred in the middle of a half-marathon.

I guess I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It certainly means a sub-37 min 10km race is definitely on the cards next year.  Who knows, maybe I can dip below 36 mins.

Not every race was as well documented as Missoula’s, but wherever professional race photographers had been present he hunted for shots of Litton among other runners. He found images of him at the end of a course, only twice at the beginning, and never in between.

I can&#39;t remember ever running 5km this fast, and what&#39;s more I&#39;ve done it off road on a grassy parkrun course, so who knows how much quicker I could be on a nice flat road 5k.  A little bit of me is disappointed: we&#39;re fast approaching the end of the season so I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to see how this translates over a nice fast flat 10k.  Sub-37min maybe?

Given the route is mostly uphill for the first 3 km and has a &quot;sting-in-the-tail&quot; in the form of a slow incline and then a sharper short hill in the last 2km, I was a little apprehensive about achieving this goal, but I didn&#39;t let that put me off.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;alignright&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Results SMS Screenshot&quot; src=&quot;/assets/SMS-Screenshot.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;My last 3 Yateley 10k results SMSs&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of taking heed of the &quot;sting-in-the-tail&quot; and saving something for the end, I opted for the approach of getting ahead of myself by the time I got to the last 2km and hope I can keep the pace up. After a bit of a quick start, which felt far too easy, I settled into a comfortable pace and ticked over the kilometres aiming to keep my average time per km well under 3:48.  I pushed it a little more than I probably should have on the long downhill section and kept things pretty constant on the long flat between 5 and 8km.  This method worked a treat and up to this point, only 1km was slower than 3:48 - the 8th.  The 9th kilometre, as expected was much slower at 4:05, but thankfully not so slow I couldn&#39;t claw things back in the last kilometre.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On entering the field for the finish, I looked up and was pleased to see the time on the clock approaching 37:45. That sub-38 was well within my grasp. So I dug in and sprinted to the finish coming in in under 38 minutes, pipping a chap at the line who passed me during my slower 9th kilometre.  My watch said 37:57.  I&#39;d done it.  By the time I got back to my car, I&#39;d received my official result text message (right): gun time: 37:58 chip time: 37:55!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last night&#39;s performance a whopping 50 seconds of my previous 10k PB (&lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/racing-update&quot;&gt;38:45&lt;/a&gt;) and a huge 1 minute 56 seconds off my previous best for this race (39:51). The Yateley 10k is deemed a slightly tough race so I&#39;m very chuffed with myself for getting my first sub-38 10k in 14 years on this run.  It does make me think what kind of time could I get over a nice flat 10k route.  Think I&#39;ll have to see if I can find such a route and find out &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I can finally say I am a sub-38 minute 10k runner again.

I already had plans to head over to my in-laws today to go mow their lawn and thought as I&#39;m in the area, I&#39;ll to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/black-park/home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Black Park parkrun&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I got up as usual, made my wife some tea and made myself a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bulletproofexec.com/how-to-make-your-coffee-bulletproof-and-your-morning-too/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bulletproof coffee&lt;/a&gt; - yes it sounds weird and disgusting, but it is surprisingly tasty.  This was only my second bulletproof coffee and I wanted to see how well it and some fruit salad and yoghurt (breakfast) would fuel me for my run and into the morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/black-park/course&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;course description&lt;/a&gt;, it sounded like the Black Park parkrun would be an great run for a fast time, and fuelled by my bulletproof coffee and the vim, vigour and vitality I woke up with, I decided I&#39;d go for it today and see if I could get a new PB.  Well, as you can see from the title of this post, I did it, and by a whopping 21 seconds.  I set a new PB (by 4 seconds) of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/results/weeklyresults?runSeqNumber=145&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;18:29 at the Reading parkrun&lt;/a&gt; last week so was very surprised to find I&#39;d knocked such a huge chunk off this week.  I think that sub-18min 5k on a fast course like this is definitely on the cards and probably this year, especially as I had the legs to out sprint two guys over the final 200m to claim &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/black-park/results/weeklyresults?runSeqNumber=161&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;3rd spot (out of 284)&lt;/a&gt;.

It is indeed flat and fast thanks to the compact paths, set in a lovely wooded park, but I think the best bit, and the part I prefer most, is the fact is a single 5k loop.  It is also a very well attended and well organised parkrun, and guess what, they have no marshalls on the route: just follow the little arrows.  If you don&#39;t see an arrow telling you to turn, don&#39;t turn.  Simple really.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and I&#39;m convinced: bulletproof coffee is definitely a tremendous fuel for running and fits in perfectly with my high fat, high protein, low carb diet.  On Wednesday evening, I&#39;ll see how well it goes with my other high fat, high protein, low carb pre-race snack: mixed nuts, which I plan to eat before running the Yately 10k.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">BBC Panorama: The Truth About Sports Products</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/bbc-panorama-the-truth-about-sports-products\"/>\n   <updated>2012-07-20T12:02:24+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/bbc-panorama-the-truth-about-sports-products</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;BBC1 broadcast an very interesting episode of Panorama last night...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; alt=&quot;Panorama&quot; src=&quot;/assets/panorama-sports.jpg&quot; width=&quot;272&quot; height=&quot;153&quot; /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Truth About Sports Products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As many of us try to get fitter in this Olympic summer, Panorama investigates the sports products that promise to boost your performance. Are those pricey trainers worth the money? Can sports drinks really help you work out for longer? Are protein shakes any more effective at honing the physique than ordinary food?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With exclusive access to the findings from a unique study by the British Medical Journal and Oxford University, reporter Shelley Jofre tests the science behind the bold advertising claims made by some of sport&#39;s biggest brands.&lt;br /&gt;\n— &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01l1yxk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Truth About Sports Products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A very interesting programme that concentrated on the marketing claims sports supplement, drink and shoe manufacturers make about how wonderful and amazing their products are and how they&#39;ll make you so much better at your sport, and the scientific evidence to support these claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can expect, pretty much everything lacked any relevant scientific backing to go with the sensational claims with some companies using very dubious studies to try and back their claims. Essentially the programme revealed that these companies have come up with very clever ways to make you, the average Joe Schmoe, pay a lot of money for sugar, salt and water and who knows what else without any real good reason.  These supplements and drinks have very little impact on the average person&#39;s performance and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They also covered the injury prevention claims made by running shoe manufacturers and, as a barefoot running fan, you&#39;ll know they came up with nothing.  To try and make a balanced argument, they mentioned barefoot running and even illustrated how running barefoot reduces impact and thus acknowledged &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/my-thoughts-on-the-lieberman-paper&quot;&gt;Daniel Lieberman&#39;s research&lt;/a&gt;. But then they turned things a bit against barefoot and minimalist running, as they did with normal running shoes, when they mentioned that Merrell also couldn&#39;t provide research proving that running in their minimalist shoes could substantiate their marketing claims.  This is a perfectly valid thing to do and good on them for doing it, but it did seem a bit hurried and &quot;matter-of-factly&quot; and seemed to neglect the fact that the barefoot running research is a lot newer and more relevant to Merrell&#39;s claims than anything out there for normal shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They did however summarise the running shoe debate by getting a scientist to basically say that until there is further research about the affects of various shoes (or not) on injury prevention, the best thing to do is buy a pair you are comfortable with and ignore all the marketing hype.  I couldn&#39;t agree more, though I&#39;d prefer it if you went for a pair of minimalist shoes or go completely barefoot &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of things made me smile in this rather serious programme.  First there was the revealing of an old world-class athlete&#39;s performance enhancing supplement: Graeme Obree showed us how to make a jam sandwich which he normally consumes with water. This and other proper foods are all the supplementation he ever used and supported by comments on other athletes doing the same today. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The second thing, and this really tickled me, was when the reporter asked Tim Noakes what the point of low calorie sports drinks is given these manufacturers claim you need the sugar and carbs etc to improve your performance.  Tim was clearly tickled by this too as they showed a section of filming indicating re-takes had to be taken as Tim couldn&#39;t control his laughing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the topic of Tim Noakes, I think this programme could have spent a lot more time interviewing Tim on the sports drinks topic.  He&#39;s a world renowned scientist in this regard and can be credited some very good studies on the topic of over-drinking and even taking on Gatorade and ultimately winning.  He&#39;s also just released a new book on the topic: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/145042497X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=145042497X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&quot;&gt;Waterlogged: The Serious Problem of Overhydration in Endurance Sports&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;ve not read this yet, but if it is anything like his coverage of this topic in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007KZS5OQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B007KZS5OQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&quot;&gt;Challenging Beliefs: Memoirs of a Career&lt;/a&gt;, it&#39;ll be a very good read.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re based in the UK or have access to a UK based proxy server, I recommend you watch this programme on BBC iPlayer.  It&#39;s a worthy use of an hour of your time and adds to my own growing beliefs, following years of experimenting on myself, that most of these products out there are a complete waste of time and money and they&#39;ll only make you fatter and poorer.  If you&#39;re not in the UK, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find a &quot;backup&quot; on the internet sometime soon &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">336km: A New Monthly Record</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/336km-a-new-monthly-record\"/>\n   <updated>2012-07-02T14:08:32+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/336km-a-new-monthly-record</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Last month was a bumper month for running for me.

Now how&#39;s that for a lot of running in a single month.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike my previous month, this month was pretty much exclusively running.  I didn&#39;t do any dedicated weights sessions or swimming as I find both of these impact my running more than I&#39;d like.  I might bring those back during the winter months when I don&#39;t always want to head outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So not only did &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/103km-in-one-week-a-new-record&quot;&gt;I run over 100km in a single week&lt;/a&gt; last month, I also set a new record for the highest mileage in a single month.  Great stuff and best of all I felt pretty good all month with the exception of the end of last week when I was feeling a little tired from a couple of late nights and some tough racing.  This &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/training-and-diet-update&quot;&gt;MAF training&lt;/a&gt; is really working for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;July won&#39;t be a bumper month as I&#39;ve got a week&#39;s holiday booked, but I think it&#39;ll still be a big month as I plan to start squeezing in more of those 100+ kilometre weeks when I get back.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Comrades Winner Tests Positive</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/comrades-winner-tests-positive\"/>\n   <updated>2012-06-20T11:31:53+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/comrades-winner-tests-positive</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.co.za/news/comrades-champ-stripped-of-title/&quot;&gt;The South African Institute for Drug-Free Sport (SAIDS) confirmed today that the 2012 Comrades winner, Ludwick Mamabolo, has tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine and could face a two year ban and be stripped of his title if found guilty by an independent tribunal.&lt;br /&gt;\n— &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.co.za/news/comrades-champ-stripped-of-title/&quot; title=&quot;Comrades Winner Tests Positive - Runner&#39;s World Magazine&quot;&gt;Comrades Winner Tests Positive - Runner&#39;s World Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is such a shame.

A New Record</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/103km-in-one-week-a-new-record\"/>\n   <updated>2012-06-17T09:36:01+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/103km-in-one-week-a-new-record</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of last week, I thought to myself: &quot;I wonder if I can do 100km of running in a week and at what point I&#39;d actually start to feel it&quot;.  Now I&#39;ve finished today&#39;s long run, I now know. YES I can, and not until the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In order to get to 100km I worked out I&#39;d have to average just over 12km a day for Monday to Saturday and then run somewhere between 22 and 25km for my long run.  As I didn&#39;t have a long run on Sunday last week, I decided on a slightly longer run on Monday (just over 16km) and then stuck to just over 12km a day for the rest of the week.  I was expecting to start to feel tired and slow as the week progressed, but I found this didn&#39;t happen.  I didn&#39;t feel tired and I actually started running my 12 or so kilometers quicker as the week progressed, whilst still keeping my heart rate in the desired range (148-153 BPM).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday and today have been the days when I&#39;ve finally felt I&#39;ve had a heavy week of training.  Yesterday I ran about 3.7km to the Reading parkrun as a warmup, &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/won-reading-parkrun&quot;&gt;ran and won the Reading parkrun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt; and then ran home again as a cooldown.  Today I ran just over 25km for my long run.  It was during the final 400m of the parkrun - my legs burnt when trying to break into a sprint into a very strong head wind - and the last 5km of today&#39;s long run that I actually felt a bit tired, but otherwise I felt great all week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those who like details, here&#39;s a screenshot of this week&#39;s training from Garmin Connect...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/103kmInAWeek.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;103km In A Week&quot; title=&quot;alt=&quot;103km In A Week&quot; src=&quot;/assets/103kmInAWeek.png&quot; width=&quot;889&quot; height=&quot;251&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Almost 104km in a week!! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever run this far in a single week. This week also takes me to 211km for the month so far.  I think my previous monthly best of 259km may just topple this month.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So will I do another 100km week again?  Almost certainly, but I think next time I&#39;ll split things down into a few more runs, maybe a double run on a Tuesday and Thursday.  When?  I&#39;m not sure, maybe the week after next.  We&#39;ll see how I feel, but now I know I can do it, I think it might become a regular event.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">I Won Reading parkrun This Morning</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/won-reading-parkrun\"/>\n   <updated>2012-06-16T09:49:08+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/won-reading-parkrun</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just won today&#39;s windy &amp; muddy Reading parkrun in what is probably one of the slowest winning times (18:50), but who cares.

This is my local race and a quick race too thanks to it being relatively flat for most of the race with a nice long downhill down Wokingham Road.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This year conditions were perfect and I went into the race with the goal of running a sub-39 minute race.  As I had such great success with the negative split in the Reading Half Marathon, I decided I&#39;d try it on the Woodley 10k too.  I started the race at a very modest pace and watched a lot of people race off ahead of me.  I started to get a little worried about this by about 2km, but I stuck to my guns and continued at the pace I was going.  It wasn&#39;t quite as slow as I&#39;d planned, but it wasn&#39;t anywhere near as fast as I felt I should be going.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started to pick the pace up at about 3km and soon realised it was a wise decision to hold off at the beginning as I started passing those that passed me right at the beginning.  I felt great and continued to pass people all the way to the finish with me passing a lot of people in the last 3km, which happens to include the only real hill in the whole race.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think I could probably have pushed things a little faster as I had sufficient left in the tank to break into a sprint for the last 100-odd meters (uphill on grass) and totally obliterate my current &quot;personal best since return&quot; (PBSR).  Prior to that race my PBSR stood at 39:42 obtained at &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-woodley-10k-2011&quot;&gt;last year&#39;s Woodley 10k&lt;/a&gt;.  I crossed the line at this year&#39;s Woodley 10k in a fantastic time of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsystems.co.uk/ss/results/athlete/?entId=SEYMO-DHLAM-COLNM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;38:45&lt;/a&gt;, smashing my previous time by a whopping 57 seconds!!!  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To say I was chuffed was an understatement.  I was thrilled to bits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;5k parkruns&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As part of my training, I&#39;ve decided that the occasional parkrun will be my speed sessions.  They&#39;re not very long, semi-formal, free and a great way to monitor my progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I ran my first parkrun for 2012 two weeks after the Reading Half marathon on 14 April and it was an OK run with me finishing in a modest time of 19:37.  This wasn&#39;t a brilliant run and I attribute this to being tired from the half marathon and due to the relatively low volume of training in March due to tapering for the half marathon (I think I was a little worried I&#39;d go into the race over trained and in retrospect I think I might have been slightly under trained).  Things were a little damp underfoot too. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a relatively high mileage week of training, I ran the Reading parkrun again a week later (21 Apr 2012) and this time ran a mere 2 seconds quicker (19:35), a far cry from my Reading parkrun personal best (PB) of 19:13, but certainly quicker than I was at this point last year. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Three more weeks of high mileage training and six days after the Woodley 10k, I ran the Reading parkrun again, with no real race plan other than to run by feel and to not look at my watch until I&#39;d finished.  I felt fantastic, ran well and smashed my previous parkrun PB by 13 seconds finishing bang on 19:00.  On discovering my finish time I was little disappointed I hadn&#39;t looked at my watch during the race as had I done so I could probably have dipped under 19 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Feeling great after the Woodley 10k and this last parkrun, and motivated by the evidence that my training was starting to pay off, I took a week off from parkrun (a few too many beers the Friday night before - my wife&#39;s colleagues&#39; fault), upped my training for the next two weeks and then raced the parkrun again this last Saturday (2 Jun 2012), once again going by feel, but this time I paid attention to my watch.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now this was a spectacular run.  I did something I don&#39;t normally do at the parkruns: I took a much longer than usual warm up run.  Normally I barely cover 1km during my warmup, this time I ran just short of 3km before the run.  I&#39;m not sure how much of an impact this had on my run, but I certainly felt great, and ran way better than expected. Are you ready for this?  I smashed my previous parkrun PB, set only two weeks earlier, by a whopping 27 seconds and finished in 18:33.  I couldn&#39;t believe it.  I&#39;d totally obliterated my previous time and I didn&#39;t feel like I was putting in that much more effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I got home and check my logs, I realised this was not only a parkrun PB, but also an all time off-road 5k PB by 2 seconds.  Unfortunately, I know this is definitely not my all time fastest 5k time as I&#39;ve run two sub-38 minute 10k&#39;s (when I was a teenager) and there is no way I could do those without running really quick 5k times.  Sadly, I don&#39;t have any records of these faster 5k times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all, racing so far this year has gone really well with 57 seconds knocked off my 10k PBSR, 40 seconds off my parkrun PB (since last year) and 2 seconds off my all time off-road 5k time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure yet what other races I&#39;ll be doing this year, but one thing is for sure: I&#39;ll be continuing my current training methods and have set myself some new goals to achieve this year.  Just holding thumbs now that I&#39;m one of the lucky people who get drawn from the ballot for the London Marathon next year; I definitely think I can do it and do it well.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Over 1000km So Far This Year</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/over-1000km-so-far-this-year\"/>\n   <updated>2012-06-07T13:24:05+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/over-1000km-so-far-this-year</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s 13km run takes me over 1000km for the year so far. 2012km for 2012 looks like an easy target at this rate.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Today&#39;s Run Will Be At Least 12km</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/todays-run-will-be-at-least-12km\"/>\n   <updated>2012-06-07T11:21:06+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/todays-run-will-be-at-least-12km</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s run will be at least 12km.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Outrun Death Itself</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/outrun-death-itself\"/>\n   <updated>2012-06-06T09:10:01+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/outrun-death-itself</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;xkcd: Outrun Death Itself&quot; src=&quot;/assets/xkcd-out_run_death.png&quot; width=&quot;655&quot; height=&quot;254&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Training and Diet Update</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/training-and-diet-update\"/>\n   <updated>2012-06-03T12:45:33+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/training-and-diet-update</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a while since I last posted about my running so this is going to be a long summary post covering my recent training and diet.  I&#39;ll write another, probably shorter, post on racing after this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Training&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Training is going really well. I&#39;m continuing to run using the maximum aerobic function (MAF) principals written about by Phil Maffetone which I &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/maf-training-anyone&quot;&gt;questioned in September last year&lt;/a&gt;.  Based on the results I&#39;m seeing and the way I&#39;m feeling, I&#39;ll continue to train using these principals.  To recap, essentially I am doing all my training in a heart rate range of 148-153 BPM.  This is based on Phil Maffetone&#39;s calculation of taking 180 - your age ± 5 depending on experience.  This value would be the maximum heart rate you should train at.  I use this as my upper limit (153) and then allow myself 5 BPM below this for most of my training and essentially means all of my training is taking place below 70% of my maximum heart rate.  All runs are effectively long and slow.  No speed work, no intervals, no threshold runs, no race pace runs, no any other kind of training used on conventional training programmes you&#39;ll find in the plethora of books and magazines out there. The closest to any of these traditional training sessions I get is racing and parkruns, which I race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once in a while I&#39;ll throw in an anaerobic training day in which I&#39;ll do 6 to 8 short sprints followed by a full body bodyweight weights workout.  I&#39;ll document this in another post some time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So far this is proving to be a very good idea.  I&#39;m clocking up more kilometers in training than I ever have and I don&#39;t feel knackered.  I can easily, and generally do, run on average 10km a day, every day, without this having any negative impact on my racing or health.  I also throw in the occasional rest day when I feel I need it.  This last month of training seems to have seen me really get into my stride, so to speak.  I clocked up my third highest training month at 249km and set a new best on the most kilometers run in a week this week with 81.69km.  I&#39;m also likely to pass 1000km for the year next week.  All of this with no signs of overtraining and no signs of injury either, touch wood.  I attribute this to this much more relaxed training pace and my change in diet, more on the diet below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also introduced a change to the way I do my long runs after last week&#39;s and today&#39;s great runs.  Instead of doing most of the run in the 148-153 BPM range, I&#39;m running the first half with my heart range below 148 BPM and then the second half with it in the MAF range.  This has had the effect that I don&#39;t find the long runs as stressful as I&#39;m not fighting my watch (it beeps when I run outside the predefined HR range) for such a long time.  It also results in a more consistent pace over the whole run as I tire.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also experimenting with using compression socks/sleeves for post-race and post-long-run recovery.  The jury is still out on the effectiveness of this, but I&#39;ll keep experimenting to see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, most of this training has not been barefoot, but it has been in minimalist - in the traditional sense and not Runner&#39;s World&#39;s definition - shoes, namely a pair of Vibram Bikilas and a pair of Merrell Trail Gloves. Runner&#39;s World call these &quot;barefoot&quot; shoes (I really hate this misnomer).  This is primarily because I&#39;m wondering all over the show to try and get the mileage in so I don&#39;t know what kind of terrain I&#39;m likely to encounter on a day-to-day basis.  I also don&#39;t think the skin on my feet can handle running 10km and more day-in-day-out on tar.  I do still however go out once in a while barefoot to keep things real &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Back in March I decided I&#39;d start to follow a &quot;paleo lite&quot; &lt;del&gt;diet&lt;/del&gt; way of life to...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;see how this would affect my body, mood and general wellbeing,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;see if it would help my body cope with a skin condition I&#39;ve got,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;see if it would help me lose a bit more weight - I&#39;d stabilised at about 79kg, and &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;because all the information I&#39;d read into the reasons behind adopting this way of life just seemed to make sense.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the curious, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paleo (short for paleolithic) diet&lt;/a&gt; is essentially a diet devoid of all grains (wheat, barley, rice, corn etc), legumes, potatoes, dairy products, salt, refined sugar, and processed oils. Instead concentrating on fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, eggs and nuts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve opted for a &quot;lite&quot; version as I&#39;m not excluding salt, dairy products (in fact I&#39;ve upped my consumption of high fat dairy products) and I regularly (normally no more than once or twice a week) include &quot;if you must&quot; items like sweet potatoes, high cocoa chocolate and olive oil in my diet for variety. I sometimes use honey as a sweetener when I fancy a bit of sweetness in my coffee.  Beer and wine are also not banned on my version, but I don&#39;t drink that much anyway. I also stray away from the paleo diet before a race of 10km or longer to give myself a slight carbo-load, in which I&#39;ll eat a bit of bread, pasta or potatoes on the night or two before the race and a bowl of oats on the morning of the run.  I also like a bowl of fruit and nut packed muesli before my long runs.  Oh yes, and once in a while we&#39;ll go out for dinner in which case I&#39;ll try to keep a paleo as possible, but I don&#39;t beat myself up about it - this isn&#39;t a weekly event anyway so won&#39;t cause any damage. Otherwise day-to-day eating is pretty much consistent with the paleo diet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The results?  Well, I&#39;m loving it.  My training is not suffering one bit and in fact I think my ability to keep training as much as I am is partly due to the change in diet. The MAF training primarily relies on burning fat for energy so having it needs a big place in my diet. I&#39;ve lost 4kg and am now at what I think is my ideal weight of 75kg (I&#39;m 183cm/6 feet tall). My skin condition has definitely improved to the point I no longer need to use any creams as I don&#39;t get the flare-ups anymore. I no longer get grumpy and snappy when I haven&#39;t eaten for a while - this was a major problem when my wife and I would go out on a Saturday morning - and I no longer get that 4pm &quot;I really fancy a choccie bar&quot; slump.  The grazing on high protein (and fat) meat, oily fish, lots of fruit, vegetables and nuts and high fat dairy has really stabilised my blood sugar levels and has definitely resulted in an overall improvement in my life.  It&#39;s a little more expensive than the previous dependency on bulky carbs, but it&#39;s definitely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in the &quot;paleo lite&quot; way of life, have a look at the mountains of information at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marksdailyapple.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mark&#39;s Daily Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all from a training and diet perspective, I think I&#39;ve found a perfect balance for me and it is working wonders.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever go back to the traditional way of training with a high reliance on chronic cardio and anaerobic training programmes.  I&#39;ll also try my damnedest to never go back to a high carb diet.  The more I read the research on the negative impact of a low fat, high carb diet, the more I&#39;m convinced society has been following the wrong guidelines for a long long time.  Of course, I will change things if something starts to go wrong, but I don&#39;t think it will.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Run Fat B!tch Run</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/run-fat-btch-run\"/>\n   <updated>2012-04-21T18:58:07+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/run-fat-btch-run</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Saw a great book in WH Smiths today...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/184744542X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=184744542X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Run Fat B!tch Run&quot; src=&quot;/assets/runfatbithrun.jpg&quot; width=&quot;261&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what the book is about other than it&#39;s about encouraging fat ladies to lose weight by running, but the title caught my attention and made me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Sound Advice from the Virgin London Marathon Organisers</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/sound-advice-from-the-virgin-london-marathon-organisers\"/>\n   <updated>2012-04-17T11:20:59+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/sound-advice-from-the-virgin-london-marathon-organisers</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Sound advice from the Virgin London Marathon organisers in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.london-marathon.co.uk/uploads/marathon-centre/Online-Final-Instructions-2012.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Final Instructions (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; on page 9 ...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Don&#39;t Wee In Peoples Gardens&quot; src=&quot;/assets/DontWeeInPeoplesGardens.png&quot; width=&quot;264&quot; height=&quot;501&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... but by all means wee in people&#39;s gardens elsewhere &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Inov-8 Bare-X 180 Minimalist Shoes Look Good</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/inov-8-bare-x-180-minimalist-shoes-look-good\"/>\n   <updated>2012-04-16T17:14:15+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/inov-8-bare-x-180-minimalist-shoes-look-good</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I was browsing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wiggle.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wiggle&lt;/a&gt; the other day and happened across these rather attractive looking, from an aesthetic and spec perspective, minimalist running shoes from Inov-8...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Inov-8 Bare X 180&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Inov-8_Bare_X_180.jpg&quot; width=&quot;521&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Product-View-BareX-180.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inov-8 Bare-X 180&lt;/a&gt; shoes (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wiggle.co.uk/inov-8-bare-x-180-shoes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here on Wiggle&lt;/a&gt;), and they&#39;re a minimalist shoe with a zero-drop, no insole and only 3mm worth of rubber between your feet and the ground below.

They make my feet look like boats, but more importantly, due to the plasticky stuff over the fabric around the edges and over the foot, they crease right over my big toes and thus rub.  This will lead to blisters for me. This is the same issue the first release of the Vivobarefoot Evos had.

This was a bit of a gamble as I&#39;d never heard anyone train like this before and had certainly never taken this approach myself. Seeing as I hadn&#39;t done a half marathon in a while, I thought &quot;&lt;em&gt;What the heck.  It&#39;ll be an interesting experiment. Worst case scenario, I blow it.  Best case, I finish the race strong and get the sub-90 minute finish time I&#39;d be aiming for&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nWell, Sunday morning arrived and it was a glorious morning.  The sun was shining, the temperature was perfect and my wife and I hopped on our bikes and took a gentle cycle to the Madejski stadium.  As it&#39;s only 6.5km away from home I opted to cycle to and from the race rather than fight with the crowds on the shuttle buses or pay for parking.  This proved to be a very wise choice as there were way more people about than I was expecting.  It also proved to be a very good warm up, so once at the stadium, I only had a short little run to do and some dynamic stretching before making my way to the start of the race.  The 30 mins I&#39;d given myself for this turned out to be plenty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite this being my first half marathon in over 13 years, I didn&#39;t go for a &quot;wing it and see&quot; approach.  I actually devised a race strategy. In order to get the sub-90 minute time I was aiming for, I decided on running a negative split, that is run the first half slower than the second.  Then I went a step further and broke the race up into three 7km chunks with the aim of running each 7km chunk in a progressively faster time. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a little bit of time with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/calculators&quot;&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt;, I came with the following splits I&#39;d aim to run for each 7km:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0 - 7km: 31:30 which is 4:30/km&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\nPlenty slow enough to deal with the first hill and the inevitable slow start caused by the sheer number of runners.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 - 14km: 30:00 which is 4:17/km&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\nThis is slightly slower than the pace I&#39;d have to have sustained if I ran a constant pace for a sub-90.  I actually planned to run this leg at about 4:16/km, the required pace, just to be safe. 30mins was an easy number to remember.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14 - 21km: 28:30 which is 4:04/km&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\nThis is quite a fast pace, but I thought I could do it, especially if my middle 7 turned out as I&#39;d hoped and took me less than 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now those with an eye for maths will notice this takes me to 90mins for 21km and a half-marathon is 21.1km.  Well, this was all about ease of calculation whilst on the run and with the final 100m being left out of the equation I knew I could always run like a man possessed for 100m at the end if need be &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; . I would however run the last 7km with the last 100m in mind anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this three-way split is it would give me a good way of assessing my pace and race in conjunction with how I felt at each point of the race and I could then make any changes as I felt fit, whilst also running a negative split.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As it so happens, my planning turned out brilliantly.  At just after 10am we were all sent on our way.  I was quite far from the start line so didn&#39;t hear the gun but registered we were off when the announcer said &quot;And they&#39;re off&quot; (about 15 seconds after starting the race).   It took me about 1 minute 15 seconds to cross the line and then I was off in the middle of a sea of people for our 21.1km around Reading.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things start off very slowly due to the sheer number of people ahead of me, but things soon started thinning out a bit, but not much, just after the 3km.  I was feeling great, enjoying the crowds and great weather and my legs just ticked over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I went through the first 7km just behind schedule in 31:36 (watch time, not gun or chip time).  Not bad at all considering there were way more people than I anticipated, congestion was quite bad at the beginning and the steepest climb fell within this period.  Happy with this and happy with the fact I was still feeling good, I picked up the pace a bit and ticked over the next 7km in 29:09 (1:00:45), going through the 10km mark in a chip time of 43:30.   A bit quicker than I&#39;d planned but I wasn&#39;t too concerned as this leg included a fair bit of downhill running and I was still feeling great.  Happy with my second leg and a bit ahead of schedule, I stepped the pace up a bit and headed for the finish line.  This last 7km was thankfully quite flat and I think it definitely helped that I knew exactly where I still had to run before getting to the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With just over 2km to go we turned back into Greenpark back onto the road on which we started for a little hair-pin loop before heading into the stadium.  It was about half way up the inbound part of the hair-pin that I saw the 1:30 (90 mins) chip time pacer for the first time since the start of the race and he shouted out that we still had a chance to catch him and dip under 90mins for the run.  I took that as a challenge and dug in deep.  I wanted to catch and pass him.  So far I was more or less on track for a sub-90, but I knew if I passed him, I&#39;d definitely do it.  It was at this point I started to feel a little tired, but I ignored those feelings and pushed on and passed the pacer on Shooters Way with about 200m to go and I just kept going.  That last 7km segment ended up being only slightly faster than the one before taking me 29:01 (1:29:46) and I entered the stadium and sped my way to the finish line, crossing in a gun time of 1:31:19.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was very happy with this time.  I&#39;d almost dipped below 90 mins for a gun time on a huge race.  Knowing that it took me somewhere between 75 and 90 seconds to cross the start line, I was quite confident I&#39;d dipped under 90 mins for my chip time, especially as I passed the pacer, but not overly so as I knew it would be close. I&#39;d have to wait for the official results to get my chip time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I did the goodie bag and medal walk through and met my wife outside the stadium.  I then went for a very short and gentle cool down run.  I ended up cutting this short as my calves were starting to cramp so instead we jumped on our bikes and headed into town for lunch.  I thought it only appropriate to take my wife out for lunch after she sat reading her Kindle in the sun in the stadium waiting for me.  This cycle into town and then ultimately on to home ended up being a great cool down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That evening I checked the race results and found this...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/MizunoReadingHalfMarathon2012Results.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Mizuno Reading Half Marathon 2012 Results - 1:29:52&quot; src=&quot;/assets/MizunoReadingHalfMarathon2012Results.png&quot; width=&quot;962&quot; height=&quot;261&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:29:52&lt;/strong&gt; !!! Yes!!!! I&#39;d done it. My racing strategy had worked perfectly, and it&#39;s just as well I didn&#39;t stick to it too closely as I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have crept under 90 mins if my middle leg had been slower.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My final position was 731 out of 13104 finishers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Job done and in my Vibram Five Fingers.  I&#39;m back to running half marathons and I&#39;ve gone under the 90 minute mark.  Now I&#39;ve done it, it should be easier to do it again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My 5k split times...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;5K: 00:22:15&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;10K: 00:43:30&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;15K: 01:04:54&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;20K: 01:25:26&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... lead me to believe I have a sub-19 5k, sub-39 10k and sub-60 15k in my legs this season and I think I&#39;ll be using these as my goals for this season.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and just before leaving the race village, I couldn&#39;t help but leave my mark...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/TopSpotReadingHalf.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot; Top Spot at the Reading Half Marathon&quot; src=&quot;/assets/TopSpotReadingHalf.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;951&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&#39;t resist grabbing the top spot at the Reading Half Marathon &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite not actually getting my race number and T-shirt in the post (I&#39;m doubtful it was even sent), this was a great race, a great route and made better by some great weather.  I&#39;ll definitely be doing this race again, but maybe not next year. We&#39;ll see how it fits in with the other halves around this time and my training.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Sh*t Runners Say</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/sht-runners-say\"/>\n   <updated>2012-02-23T09:47:37+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/sht-runners-say</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Runners are strange creatures.  We get up at insane hours of the morning to run insane distances on an almost daily basis.  Along with this comes all the banter about these shoes, that injury, and the next best running gadget or race you must run.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Recently talk has turned to barefoot and minimalist running and along with it a whole new topic of discussion for those long Sunday runs. As with anything new or different, you always get the &quot;experts&quot; and those who get a bit over enthusiastic and this is what Steven Sashen of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.invisibleshoe.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Invisible Shoes&lt;/a&gt; has capitalised on for this first video, &quot;Sh*t Barefoot Runners Say&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/NPdb7ZDJKS4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&#39;s also the flip side, which Steven has just captured in his sequel... &quot;Sh*t Runners Say to Barefoot Runners&quot;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/erorsuyJKiQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve said any of the things in the first, but I&#39;ve definitely been the recipient of many of the comments in the second.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Tim Noakes: &amp;quot;If you&#39;ve got Lore of Running, tear out the section on nutrition&amp;quot;</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tim-noakes-if-youve-got-lore-of-running-tear-out-the-section-on-nutrition\"/>\n   <updated>2012-02-02T14:35:37+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tim-noakes-if-youve-got-lore-of-running-tear-out-the-section-on-nutrition</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m slowly working my way through Phil Maffetone&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1616080655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1616080655&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing&lt;/a&gt; and I must say it&#39;s quite a varied read.  One topic I&#39;ve just finished reading is about carbohydrate intolerance. &lt;a href=&quot;http://philmaffetone.com/2weektest.cfm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Carbohydrate Intolerance and the Two-Week Test&lt;/a&gt; gives a good idea what the chapter is about, though this post doesn&#39;t go into the performance affecting aspects like the book does.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve read on numerous occasions, and with ever increasing regularity now, about how maybe we&#39;ve got it all wrong and we really shouldn&#39;t be consuming anywhere near the level of carbs that we do, but this is the first time I&#39;ve actually seen anyone correlate common aches and pains with our carbohydrate rich diets.  This is quite an interesting topic, which I&#39;m eager to test, especially if it&#39;ll have a positive impact on my overall health and running performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nA couple of days after reading this chapter, I happened to notice a few people mention Tim Noakes and his new low-carb diet on Twitter.  Apparently Tim has been talking quite a bit about his new found confidence in high protein and fat diets.  Recently, he&#39;s given a talk for Runner&#39;s World ZA, written articles for numerous publications (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.discovery.co.za/email_za/mailers/pdfs/general/noakes.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Discovery Newsletter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.modernathlete.co.za/index_features.asp?ArticleID=788&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Modern Athlete&lt;/a&gt; and Southern Suburbs Tatler - I can&#39;t find this article, but it&#39;s discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.health24.com/dietnfood/Diet_basics/15-1168-1173,66523.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and was also interviewed on a top talk show station in South Africa: Radio 702 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://zebra.bookslive.co.za/blog/2012/01/24/podcast-tim-noakes-says-athletes-should-not-always-carbo-load/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;listen to it here&lt;/a&gt;) in which he puts his hands up and says he got it wrong all those years ago. After some self-experimentation, he now believes we really should not be consuming anywhere near as many carbs as we&#39;ve previously been advised by him and many other scientists, and instead we should be consuming high levels of protein and fat. In other words, there&#39;s some truth to the apparent madness that is the Atkins Diet.  He even goes on to say &quot;&lt;em&gt;If you&#39;ve got Lore of Running, tear out the section on nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&quot; because he no longer believes this information is correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The second edition of his autobiography, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1770221468/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1770221468&quot;&gt;Challenging Beliefs: Memoirs of a Career&lt;/a&gt;, due out in May, will go into more detail about his change of view.  I&#39;ve added it to my Kindle wishlist and will definitely be purchasing this when the 2nd edition becomes available.  Until then, Tim recommends people read Gary Taubes’s books: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1400033462/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1400033462&quot;&gt;Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0307474259/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0307474259&quot;&gt;Why We Get Fat: And What to Do about It (Vintage)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1444710338/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1444710338&quot;&gt;The Dukan Diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve always admired Tim Noakes for his expertise and now even more so.  It takes a certain kind of person to put their hands up and say they got it wrong on a topic they&#39;ve been promoting for years.  You&#39;ve really got to admire Tim Noakes for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Time to dig out that old copy of the Atkins Diet sitting on our bookcase.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">259km: A New Monthly Record</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/259km-a-new-monthly-record\"/>\n   <updated>2012-02-01T11:01:16+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/259km-a-new-monthly-record</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#39;s run saw me log my highest monthly mileage total of 259km...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Screenshots/i-J4GvnXJ/0/X2/Jan-2012-Training-X2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Jan-2012-Training-M.png&quot; alt=&quot;I ran 259km in January 2012&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;401&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;I ran 259km in January 2012&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My previous high was 252km in November 2011.  Now the fact these two are quite close to each other - we could say right after each other as December doesn&#39;t really count as I was on holiday for most of the month - is no coincidence.  Since September I&#39;ve been experimenting with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/maf-training-anyone&quot;&gt;Maximum Aerobic Function (MAF)&lt;/a&gt; training as promoted/devised by Phil Maffetone and I&#39;m really enjoying it and starting to see results.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially all my training is just a lot of long and slow running done at a specific heart rate. No interval workouts, no threshold runs, no tempo runs, no racing, no anything-that-would-over-stress-the-body running.  I&#39;m finding that I feel moderately tired after a long run, but not absolutely knackered. Best of all, I feel great the next day and I can easily take another long run without feeling the strain. Case in point, on 22 January I ran my longest long run in a very very long time (just over 22km in 2 hours) and I felt great the next day and ran just over 9.5km that day. If so inclined, I could probably easily run two moderately long runs in a day if I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think I&#39;ve also found a good training routine/pattern that my body seems to like: three high mileage weeks each with 5-6 runs, one of which is a long run, and one swimming session followed by one week low mileage with a swim.  I&#39;ve dropped the weight lifting sessions as I actually feel more knackered after these than after a long run. I now have Phil Maffetone&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1616080655/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1616080655&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing&lt;/a&gt; and in here he recommends no weight training take place during the base building phase.  Now I have the book, I&#39;m also starting to do the monthly MAF tests properly, so we&#39;ll see in a couple of months exactly how much improvement I&#39;m getting from this long-slow running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all, I&#39;m really enjoying my running at the moment and I think I might be in for a bumper year in terms of mileage.  Lets just hope the race times plummet too.  The first test will be the Reading half-marathon on 1 April.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">It&#39;s Official: Barefoot IS Best</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/its-official-barefoot-is-best\"/>\n   <updated>2012-01-12T17:25:08+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/its-official-barefoot-is-best</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Barefoot is Best&quot; src=&quot;/assets/barefoot_is_best.jpg&quot; width=&quot;464&quot; height=&quot;249&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is now official, barefoot is best.

Approximately 74% of runners experienced a moderate or severe injury each year, but those who habitually rearfoot strike had approximately twice the rate of repetitive stress injuries than individuals who habitually forefoot strike. Traumatic injury rates were not significantly different between the two groups. A generalized linear model showed that strike type, sex, race distance, and average miles per week each correlate significantly (p&lt;0.01) with repetitive injury rates.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Competitive cross country runners on a college team incur high injury rates, but runners who habitually rearfoot strike have significantly higher rates of repetitive stress injury than those who mostly forefoot strike. This study does not test the causal bases for this general difference. One hypothesis, which requires further research, is that the absence of a marked impact peak in the ground reaction force during a forefoot strike compared to a rearfoot strike may contribute to lower rates of injuries in habitual forefoot strikers.\r\n\r\n(C)2012The American College of Sports Medicine&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/publishahead/Foot_Strike_and_Injury_Rates_in_Endurance_Runners_.98750.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Foot Strike and Injury Rates in Endurance Runners: a retrospective study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The sample size isn&#39;t very big and it doesn&#39;t conclusively prove barefoot it better than shod running - barefoot isn&#39;t even mentioned - but if they can come to their conclusion from such a small sample, we can further extrapolate to say barefoot has got to be better as you will almost certainly land on your forefoot when running barefoot.  It&#39;s hurts too much not to. &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now to see if I can get my hands on that paper.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Delta Park Parkrun: My First African Parkrun</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/delta-park-parkrun-my-first-african-parkrun\"/>\n   <updated>2012-01-04T14:37:22+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/delta-park-parkrun-my-first-african-parkrun</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Over the Christmas holidays, I was compelled (a visit was due anyway) to return to sunny South Africa for the first time in five years - my first Christmas back in SA in 7 years - by my cousin&#39;s desire to marry a gun-toting children&#39;s pastor (lovely chap).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As part of my holiday back home, I decided I&#39;d venture out to see what South Africa&#39;s first and only (at the moment) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.co.za/delta/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;parkrun&lt;/a&gt; was like.  It&#39;d been a very very very long time since I last ran in South Africa, let alone raced, and from the one other run I&#39;d had in Jo&#39;burg during my hols, a gentle 10k, I knew it would be a toughie.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So nice and early on Christmas eve, I bundled my wife into the car and we headed down to Delta Park for a quick spin round the park (me - my wife doesn&#39;t run). We got there with about half an hour to spare so I could warm up and introduce myself to the organiser - the one and only, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Fordyce&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bruce Fordyce&lt;/a&gt;. During the intros it came to light there were quite a few of us &quot;foreign&quot; bods there. There was me, another chap from Cambridge (also a Saffer) and 3 Kiwis, all doing our first SA parkrun. It was also a much larger turn out than expected with 24 people, which isn&#39;t bad considering up until that point the record had been 31 with absolutely no publicity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Around about 9am we all gathered for a photo...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/6573467975_a2f8b5f33d_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Delta Park Parkrun - 24 December 2011&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;The skinny guy to my left blitzed round in 17:10&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... and set off for what is probably the toughest parkrun you&#39;ll encounter.  Due to Delta Park&#39;s location and the general geography of Johannesburg, hills are unavoidable, and boy is this a hilly run.  Thankfully it&#39;s only a single-lapper (I prefer single lap runs) scenic run with a good mix of trails, grass and tar.  I&#39;ve only done the Reading and the Delta Park parkruns (note to self: I really must aim to do other parkruns this year) and I definitely prefer the Delta Park run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A combination of the altitude, hills and varied terrain saw me finish in 7th place in a rather slow time of 21:43. You&#39;d be amazed how much of an impact altitude has on your running performance - it&#39;s really hard work running at about 1600m above sea level, especially up hill, after only training at sea level for several years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, things didn&#39;t go well for everyone...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Aristotle was correct or perhaps it&#39;s because we South Africans are still bitter about the rugby World Cup but we somehow contrived to welcome our All Black friends by planting a snake (suspected Rinkhals- spitting cobra) in the first 300 metres of open grassland. A few minutes after we had set off Kelly hobbled back with a bite above her ankle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kelly was rushed off to hospital where she was treated and discharged a couple of hours later. The doctors were not entirely convinced that she had suffered a snake bite-. And we comforted ourselves by remembering that many venomous snakes are extremely reluctant to exhaust their poison in defense  prefering to save venom for their prey.  In other words they bite often but don&#39;t expel poison. The Rinkhals much prefers fat rats, toads and other snakes to skinny Kiwis. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.co.za/delta/news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Christmas Eve 2011 Race Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll never get that kind of excitement and action at a parkrun in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I didn&#39;t get the chance to run another parkrun whilst in SA, but Bruce plans on putting the marketing engine into full swing this year to get the word out that parkrun has made it to SA and needs runners.  If all goes well, parkruns will be sprouting up all over South Africa in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I wish them the best of luck and will definitely be bringing my barcode with me when I next visit South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Tackling The 10 Myths Of Barefoot Running</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tackling-the-10-myths-of-barefoot-running\"/>\n   <updated>2012-01-04T13:38:17+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tackling-the-10-myths-of-barefoot-running</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Great and well balanced &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.podiatrytoday.com/tackling-10-myths-barefoot-running&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article from Podiatry Today busting the myths&lt;/a&gt; commonly associated with barefoot running.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Welcome to 2012</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/welcome-to-2012\"/>\n   <updated>2012-01-01T00:00:01+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/welcome-to-2012</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/eyrephotographyaustralia/6606243535/&quot; title=&quot;2012 steps by tim phillips photos, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/6606243535_52b413580d_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; alt=&quot;2012 steps&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Happy new year everyone and welcome to 2012.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you all had a good barefoot 2011 and that 2012 is even better with even more barefoot and minimalist running.

I&#39;ve not run any races, but I can see the positive effects as I cover more distance in the same amount of time at lower heart rates - I&#39;m currently doing lots of long slow runs using a bastardized version of the training ideas in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tricoachjill.com/page/page/4110957.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this HADD Article&lt;/a&gt; which I discovered when investigating the merits of &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/maf-training-anyone&quot;&gt;MAF training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As this is going well, I started to umm and aahhh about stepping things up a bit and started putting some serious thought into running a half-marathon.  I&#39;ve not run a half-marathon in well over 13 years and I finally feel my training is up to a point where I can complete a half-marathon, and in a pretty competitive time (ie sub-90 mins).  I wasn&#39;t sure if I should do the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wokinghamhalfmarathon.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wokingham half&lt;/a&gt; in February, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readinghalfmarathon.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reading half&lt;/a&gt; in April or both.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, after a lot of umming and ahhhing, I&#39;ve finally taken the plunge and entered next year&#39;s Reading half.  Whilst I think I could probably comfortably do both the Wokingham and Reading halves, I think it&#39;s probably best to take things slowly and enter only one that early in the year.  The Reading half is the larger of the two, so I&#39;ve opted for that one.  Maybe 2013 will see me do both.  We&#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That said, running the Reading half-marathon is expensive.  The entry fee is £31.50 for an affiliated athlete and £2 more for unaffiliated.  As a friend pointed out on Facebook, it&#39;s cheaper to catch the train!!!  The Wokingham half is only £18 for an affiliated athlete.

Actually, this is the first new coat of paint on &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk&quot;&gt;barefootrunner.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; since I launched it way back in September 2008 and I&#39;ve decided to go for a super lean and mean look and layout.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those reading this via a feed, you&#39;ll have to pop by to see the new design.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you spot any problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Can You Run Round the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake?</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/can-you-run-round-the-redgrave-pinsent-rowing-lake\"/>\n   <updated>2011-11-25T15:52:25+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/can-you-run-round-the-redgrave-pinsent-rowing-lake</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I work across the Thames from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redgrave_Pinsent_Rowing_Lake&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake&lt;/a&gt; and on many occasions I&#39;ve thought to myself, &quot;Can you run round the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake?&quot;. I&#39;ve plotted a route on Google Maps on several occasions and it appeared do-able, but never actually tried it, until today &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last week I noticed them doing some severe mowing over on that side of the river so today I thought I&#39;d go see if I could run right round and answer that question...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Can you run round the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After today&#39;s run, I can say: YES. Yes you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; run round the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake.  Look, I did it (switch to the Google Satellite view to get the most accurate data):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;465&quot; height=&quot;548&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://connect.garmin.com:80/activity/embed/130800271&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Would you want to run round the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Probably not.  It&#39;s not the easiest of runs. There&#39;s also one major hurdle to get over, but I&#39;ll get on to that in a moment.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the above route, I started at the David Lloyd gym and headed downstream along the Thames to Sonning, crossed Sonning bridge, diced with death for a little while before cutting into Sonning Eye.  I then followed the signs and road for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readingsc.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reading Sailing Club&lt;/a&gt;.  Once there, I continued straight through their car park and out the outside.  Up until this point, things were pretty easy.  Nice smooth flat paths and gravel roads.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once through the sailing club car park, I followed a foot path which got progressively narrow and harder to follow.  After a little detour and a short stumble through some nettles up to my waist, I back-tracked a bit and started following a path along the shore line.  Soon this too started to narrow and fade and on several occasions I found myself stopping to locate the path again.  After a couple more minutes of running, the I got the distinct feeling the paths were no longer from human traffic, but more likely wildlife traffic as I found myself ducking under low branches and leaping over thorny bushes.  I also ran through shoulder high reeds, still following a path, until eventually I ran out of land.  I&#39;d followed the shore of the main lake and rounded a small lake being fed by the larger lake.  Two ankle deep wading steps were called for and I was back on my way along a path.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a little more rambling and fighting for a path, I entered a very large opening which had recently been mown.  From here onwards things were pretty easy going and I started getting quite cocky with myself thinking I could come along with a machete and clear away the tougher bits of the path I&#39;d just covered and this could be a regular route.  I also secretly hoped they&#39;d mow this bit I was running across regularly.  Soon I found myself on the lovely smooth tarred section that runs along the north side of the rowing lake heading towards the clubhouse and my route out onto the road and back to the gym.  And then I encountered my major hurdle: an 8 foot high green metal fence with pointy bits on top.  Yes folks, the Oxfordshire side of the rowing lake is all fenced in with no pedestrian gates and the only gate out being the electric one by the clubhouse, which required a pin code. Oh poooh!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I doubled back on myself and ran back along the rowing path to see if I could find a convenient place to scale the fence.  No luck.  That&#39;s one high fence, and given the spikes on the fence and the brambles and other wild vegetation on either side, I didn&#39;t want to risk clambering over in my wet shoes.  So cap-in-hand I went back to the club house, ventured in, surprised a very friendly man in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britishrowing.org/gb-rowing-team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Team GB&lt;/a&gt; tracksuit, explained how I got in and asked if he could let me out.  Surprised by how I got in, the man kindly let me out and I was on my way.  I felt like a captive bird set free.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I then foolishly thought I spotted a shortcut back, which turned out not to be and soon found myself heading back towards where I&#39;d come from.  Thankfully, this time the fence next to me was only waist high, so I jumped that and diced with death back to Sonning Eye; running head-on into traffic on narrow roads without any pavements is pretty daunting.  Once in Sonning Eye, it was plain sailing back to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;So, would I do it again?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Definitely not.  I enjoyed by run today, but I don&#39;t think the rowing peeps will be too happy with me repeatedly asking to be let out like a puppy needing a wee.  I also don&#39;t think my legs can handle too many scratching sessions like today&#39;s and I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be whacking a convenient path for me anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So there you have it folks... if you&#39;ve run along the Thames and wondered if you could run round the Redgrade Pinsent rowing lake, I can proudly say you can, but you probably don&#39;t want to.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">It&#39;s Super Mario, I Mean, Fetchpoint Time!!!</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/its-super-mario-time\"/>\n   <updated>2011-11-18T15:58:08+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/its-super-mario-time</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fetchpoint&quot; src=&quot;/assets/fetchpoint_banner.jpg&quot; width=&quot;795&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last weekend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fetcheveryone&lt;/a&gt; released a new game - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/game-fetchpoint.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fetchpoint&lt;/a&gt; - and I think I&#39;m becoming a bit of a coin-collecting addict, and the game is only in &quot;test mode&quot;.  The official go-live is not until January.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what is Fetchpoint and how does it relate to running?&quot; I hear you ask.  Well, the whole concept of the game is you collect credits by running, walking, swimming, hopping, skipping and jumping or any other form of activity that can be deemed exercise and for which you can log an entry on Fetch and generate a route, either manually or via GPS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you run around your &#39;hood, you collect points and get docked points depending on which marker you run through (you technically only need to get within 80m of it).  At this early state, these are the markers and their descriptions from the Game Guide:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fetchpoint Markers&quot; src=&quot;/assets/markers.png&quot; width=&quot;514&quot; height=&quot;464&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently, more markers will be added as the game evolves. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the 6 days since this was launched I&#39;ve kind of neglected the other game I was playing (Conquercise) in favour of running a lot closer to home or work on some very weird and strange winding routes.  I&#39;m also not entirely sure how the scoring works as I seem to jump huge numbers each day.  Today, for example, I jumped from about 7000 points to well over 11200.  Yes, the 12.5km route was a windy coin-collecting session through some neighbourhoods I&#39;d never been through and probably never will again (lets just say I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t dark), but never expected to collect over 4000 credits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think Fetchpoint really appeals to my competitive nature as not only do I see my monthly and annual mileage total increase after each run, but I also see my credits rocketing too.  Now if only I could convert those to cash &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, all this coin collecting has put the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiAxiGZKpGQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Super Mario Brothers game music&lt;/a&gt; and sound effects in my head during several runs now, and I regularly get the urge to jump at random points in my run.  Have a listen for yourself and if you go out coin-collecting, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll pop into your head too.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">100-Up Looks Vaguely Familiar</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/100-up-looks-vaguely-familiar\"/>\n   <updated>2011-11-14T16:18:47+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/100-up-looks-vaguely-familiar</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago Chris McDougall caused another little stir in the barefoot/minimalist running world with an article for The New York Times entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/magazine/running-christopher-mcdougall.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Once and Future Way to Run&lt;/a&gt;.  Within this article he mentions something called the 100-Up exercise...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I may have found it. I was leafing through the back of an out-of-print book, a collection of runners’ biographies called “The Five Kings of Distance,” when I came across a three-page essay from 1908 titled “W. G. George’s Own Account From the 100-Up Exercise.” According to legend, this single drill turned a 16-year-old with almost no running experience into the foremost racer of his day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I read George’s words: “By its constant practice and regular use alone, I have myself established many records on the running path and won more amateur track-championships than any other individual.” And it was safe, George said: the 100-Up is “incapable of harm when practiced discreetly.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Could it be that simple? That day, I began experimenting on myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;[... two pages later ...]&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last fall, at the end of a local 10-mile trail race, I surprised myself by finishing five minutes faster than I had four years ago, when I was in much better shape. I figured the result was a fluke — until it happened again. No special prep, awful travel schedule and yet a personal best in a six-mile race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I don’t get it,” I told Cucuzzella this past June when we went for a run together through the Shepherd University campus in Shepherdstown. “I’m four years older. I’m pretty sure I’m heavier. I’m not doing real workouts, just whatever I feel like each day. The only difference is I’ve been 100-Upping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this last bit got everyone excited and within days, Justin of &lt;a href=&quot;http://birthdayshoes.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Birthday Shoes&lt;/a&gt; fame, knocked up a dedicated site - &lt;a href=&quot;http://hundredup.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HundredUp&lt;/a&gt; - to raise awareness and put out &lt;a href=&quot;http://hundredup.com/the-100-up-challenge/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a challenge&lt;/a&gt; to people to try it themselves for 30 days and report back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, as I&#39;m keen on learning about improving my performance, I read through McDougall&#39;s article, watched the video, and read through the HundredUp site.  McDougall&#39;s demonstration of the exercise in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.nytimes.com/video/2011/11/02/magazine/100000001149415/the-lost-secret-of-running.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video in the NYT&lt;/a&gt; article instantly rang bells, but I couldn&#39;t place why.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was only this weekend that I worked it out... this is a lot like the &quot;tapping&quot; and &quot;change of support&quot; exercises from POSE running, except with more emphasis on high knees than on bringing the foot up under your body.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Compare for yourself.  First, the 100-Up video which shows the minor and major:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/by-rbM101XE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next, the tapping and change of support exercises from POSE (the commentary is in German, but you&#39;re only meant to be looking at the pictures &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;)...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/O8GZatLrgGw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/qhWFZ_Fe27Y?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interesting stuff. Of course there will be some overlap in methods taught - I&#39;m sure Chi Running probably has a similar exercise too - and for all I know, Dr. Romanov could have taken some of his inspiration from W.G. George&#39;s 100-ups.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever the reasoning, I think any exercise that encourages people to land on their mid-foot or forefoot and that strengthens the muscles and tendons around that area is better than nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Bruised Toes</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/bruised-toes\"/>\n   <updated>2011-11-13T16:58:07+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/bruised-toes</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;About two thirds of the way into my long run today I somehow managed to trip over something and severely stub my toes.

I think they&#39;re just a little on the bruised side. Thankfully I was wearing my Merrells.  Who knows that my toes would look like had I not been.  Hopefully this won&#39;t affect my running too much.  I managed to finish my run this morning which entailed about another 7km after the stubbing without any discomfort.  We&#39;ll see how things are tomorrow.  Time to go ice them.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Bruce Fordyce Takes Parkruns to South Africa</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/bruce-fordyce-takes-parkruns-to-south-africa\"/>\n   <updated>2011-10-06T13:34:29+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/bruce-fordyce-takes-parkruns-to-south-africa</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; alt=&quot;Parkrun Logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/parkrun.png&quot; width=&quot;205&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I&#39;ve just received this weeks&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.com/about/news&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parkrun newsletter&lt;/a&gt; (dated 6th October 2011) and I&#39;m very chuffed to find this within it:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My reason for returning to South Africa was to spend a few days with an African running hero who has decided to bring parkrun to the masses in his homeland. Many of you were previously introduced to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Fordyce&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bruce Fordyce&lt;/a&gt; last year when he ran Bushy parkrun the day before completing his forth London Marathon. For the unenlightened, Bruce is a running legend throughout the world with many records to his name not least of which is the nine wins at the grueling &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comrades_Marathon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Comrades Ultra Marathon&lt;/a&gt; of which eight wins were consecutive. Bruce has won the London to Brighton ultra marathon three years in a row plus a number of other highly significant events and still holds the world record at 50 miles. He is a previous record holder for 100 mile distance too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I first met Bruce in 1987 when I was part of a 6-man team providing information and support during his 7th Comrades win. Little did I know the circle would be closed when Bruce took part in the Bushy parkrun this year and decided that parkrun was something that South Africa needed. Introducing parkrun to Africa is not without challenges as the majority of the population does not have Internet access and don’t receive email. Nevertheless, it is with excitement and pride that I announce that Bruce is now our Southern Africa parkrun representative and if all goes to plan in the next few weeks we will see the first African parkrun start in Delta Park, Johannesburg on the 12th November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is brilliant news and I can almost guarantee this will be an incredible success.  I would expect this Parkrun will be very busy from day one and I reckon it&#39;ll surpass any UK event in number of runners within a few weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I used to run for the club Bruce runs for, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rac.co.za/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rand Athletic Club&lt;/a&gt;, (I&#39;m assuming he still runs for RAC, I&#39;ve not seen anything to say he doesn&#39;t) which is one of South Africa&#39;s largest running clubs with over 2300 members.  They already have a very popular weekly 5 and 8k time trial on Tuesday evenings and I would expect these Parkruns to be just as popular, especially as Delta Park isn&#39;t far from Old Parktonian Sports Club.   Delta Park is also nicely situated for Randburg&#39;s other large club, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randburgharriers.co.za/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Randburg Harriers&lt;/a&gt;, so if you add their numbers too, this will be huuuge in no time. Of course the Randburg Harriers runners may not be too happy with the Parkruns clashing with their Saturday time trials, but who knows, maybe they&#39;ll ditch the Saturday runs in favour of the Parkruns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll certainly be keeping an eye on the developments of this and may just pop round for a quick spin round Delta Park (I haven&#39;t run in Delta Park since I ran cross-country in high school) when I&#39;m over in December.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">I Nearly Killed a Child</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/i-nearly-killed-a-child\"/>\n   <updated>2011-09-28T10:24:49+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/i-nearly-killed-a-child</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, my barefoot running antics nearly killed a child.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was out running through Caversham and got the usual comments about running without any shoes on. The level of intelligence in today&#39;s youth is truly amazing - &quot;&lt;em&gt;Hey, you&#39;ve got no shoes on&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.  &quot;&lt;em&gt;Really?  I hadn&#39;t noticed. Thanks for pointing it out. I&#39;ll remember to check my feet next time I head out for a run&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. :-|&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on my return to the gym, as I was crossing &lt;a href=&quot;http://g.co/maps/9mekr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reading bridge (George Street)&lt;/a&gt; to head back along the Thames path, I encountered a particularly &quot;intelligent&quot; woman and watched her nearly kill her child because of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those who don&#39;t know, George Street across Reading bridge is a particularly busy road.  It&#39;s one of only two large bridges across the Thames in Reading that is usable by large trucks and a lot of cars going to or coming from Oxfordshire, from and to Reading. This, along with Caversham bridge (the other big bridge) is naturally a very busy road.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s not very easy to cross as there are only three crossings, one on the Reading end of the road and two close to each other on the Caversham end.  To make matters worse, there is a park entrance just on the Caversham side of the bridge, just below the crest as you head into Caversham.  This spot is  particularly popular with pedestrians who can&#39;t be bothered to walk under the bridge to cross the road, and it is here that I nearly killed a child.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I ran up George Street I noticed two women with a pushchair standing on the side of the road by the park entrance waiting for a gap in the traffic so they could cross.  A gap appeared in the traffic coming from Caversham (the direction I was coming from) so the women started to make their move.  The woman pushing the push chair pushed it off the curb and completely into the road.  She remained standing on the pavement. She then noticed me - the expression on her face was priceless - running towards her without any shoes on.  This must have been far too much for her simple mind to cope with as she just stopped dead still with her child in the pushchair in the middle of the road.  She then waited for me to reach her just so she could tell me I wasn&#39;t wearing any shoes.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now the thing is, I only run at about 10kph.  Cars cross that bridge at around 50kph (30mph).  Naturally I was overtaken by a car so a car got to her before I did.  Thankfully the driver was paying more attention than the woman was as the driver slowed down and leant on his hooter for a good long loud BEEEEEEEP!!!!  This nearly scared the sh*t out of the woman with her child in the middle of the road as she jumped back but let go of the pushchair leaving the child in the road.  Just as well her friend had the right mind to grab the pushchair and pull it back onto the pavement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now comes the unbelievable part: once the woman recovered she still took the time to tell me I wasn&#39;t wearing any shoes when I did eventually pass her. Unbelievable!!

There are a few races left this year I might look to do before Christmas, but nothing I&#39;ve got my heart set on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, it means it&#39;s time to start building up the base for next year&#39;s racing season.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today I discovered maximum aerobic function (MAF) training (&lt;a href=&quot;http://philmaffetone.com/files/Want_Speed_Slow_Down_2007.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; from Phil Maffetone who came up with the idea).  Essentially, you take 180, subtract your age, add or subtract a bit more based on health and experience and then use the range of that number less about 10 bpm as your training range. You then do all your &quot;base&quot; training in that range and see great results.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This all sounds well and good and the long term results sound good, but I&#39;m concerned about this rather generic approach, especially considering if I took 180 and subtracted my age (31) and added 5 (I pretty much meet criteria 4 in the link above), I get a heart rate of 154 BPM.  This is not very high at all, especially considering that I&#39;ve clocked a maximum HR during a race (Woodley 10k in which I set my season best) of 203 this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone had any experience with using this MAF method for their base training?  I&#39;m interested in the positive and negative experiences people may have had.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The other approach I&#39;ve been contemplating is Arthur Lydiard&#39;s run a &quot;million miles a week&quot; approach, but that scares me, unless of course you&#39;ve got some good information on that topic too.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Mo Farah Wins 5000m Final at the 2011 Daegu World Champs</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/mo-farah-wins-5000m-final-at-the-2011-daegu-world-champs\"/>\n   <updated>2011-09-05T11:10:40+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/mo-farah-wins-5000m-final-at-the-2011-daegu-world-champs</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just caught up on the coverage of the men&#39;s 5000m final at the 2011 Daegu World Champs and Mo Farah is on fire.

His dad used to coach us when we both lived back in South Africa. I think he had an OK race.  He started off very well but got left in the dust when the pace picked up quite considerably at about 2600m.

I would just run and listen to my body, with the exception that I would do a long run on the weekend.  If I felt good and felt I could go fast, I did.  If I felt like plodding, I did.  This worked really well and I ended up only wearing my Garmin to record my route and distance as evidence of my progress and only checked it at the end of each run.  It&#39;s quite refreshing just running again without any trying to run to clock or beeping pacer.  I think I&#39;m going to start doing this more often.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now forcing myself to run everyday has taught me a few very important things. Running every day is fantastic, when you&#39;re up for, but you MUST listen to your body and take a break when it says you need one. If you don&#39;t and you run, you won&#39;t enjoy it and may start to resent it. You&#39;re also likely to incur aches and pains and niggles or even a full on injury if you don&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think I may have gone out a bit too far a few times in the first 3 and a bit weeks and by Friday the 26, I really wasn&#39;t up for running and starting to feel a little over-trained.  This is when I&#39;d normally take a day or two off, but didn&#39;t as I was aiming to complete this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I&#39;ve had to force myself to take a break after 30 days.  I find myself feeling a little over-trained with my right hip flexor a little tender after runs.  I wouldn&#39;t call it an injury, just an annoying niggle that wasn&#39;t there before. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll give myself the best part of a week off and start a similar challenge again, but this time without any rigid goals.  Who knows, maybe 3 long hard weeks is my limit and maybe the 4th needs to be considerably lower in mileage than I did.  Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I&#39;m very impressed with is the monthly total: 231.18k of running.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Amazing Finish in the Men’s 10,000m at the 2011 Daegu World Champs</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/-amazing-finish-in-the-men-s-10000m-at-the-2011-daegu-world-champs\"/>\n   <updated>2011-08-28T19:40:32+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/-amazing-finish-in-the-men-s-10000m-at-the-2011-daegu-world-champs</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I watched this live this morning on the BBC and must say I was on the edge of my seat.  This was probably the most gripping 10,000m race I&#39;ve watched and oh so close for Mo Farah.

Over the same distance, Farah takes 31.5 steps in about 9.3 seconds, for a cadence of 203.23 steps/min. What this suggests is that Jeilan was able to ramp up his turnover during the final stretch to catch up to and pass Mo Farah just before the finish line, whereas Farah’s turnover remained consistent. The one additional step gained by Jeilan by ramping his turnover up was enough for the win!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My money is on Mo Farah for the Olympic Gold in 2012.

Adidas appear to be taking a brave and bold step into the world of &quot;barefoot shoes&quot; (what a silly expression) with their own Vibram Five Finger-a-likees, the Adidas Adipure:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Adidas Adipure (side)&quot; src=&quot;/assets/adipure5-side.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;253&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Adidas Adipure (bottom)&quot; src=&quot;/assets/adipure5-bottom.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;265&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Adidas Adipure (top)&quot; src=&quot;/assets/adipure5-top.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Photos from &lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/5833741/working-out-barefoot-with-the-adidas-adipure-trainers-is-really-weird-but-good-for-you&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I see it, this is an interesting development.  First, Adidas appears to be making a much bigger statement about the potential impact of minimalist shoes on their market than any of the other major brands have dared do - Nike Frees are NOT minimalist or &quot;like barefoot&quot;.  I don&#39;t care what Nike say.  Secondly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://birthdayshoes.com/vibram-fivefingers-sues-fila-skele-toes-for-patent-infringement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vibrams are currently suing Fila for patent infringement&lt;/a&gt;.  Has Adidas licensed these patents from Vibram or are they going in guns blazing and hoping to dig themselves out when the pooh when it hits the fan?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve already got 3 pairs of Vibram Five Fingers (VFF) and really enjoy running in them.  I also quite like the look of these new Adidas Adipures and if the planned price is anything to go by, they&#39;ll be offering a good alternative to VFFs at a comparable price.  The pictures and the Gizmodo review however concern me a bit: they seem to indicate a fair bit of cushioning so I&#39;d like to try these on before coughing up my cash.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Long Runs are Back and They&#39;re Good</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/long-runs-are-back-and-theyre-good\"/>\n   <updated>2011-08-07T13:22:56+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/long-runs-are-back-and-theyre-good</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;My new &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/challenge-run-at-least-3km-everyday-for-30-days&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;30 day challenge&lt;/a&gt; has already helped my running... it&#39;s given me the motivation to actually starting doing long runs on the weekends again.  Today I headed out for my first weekend long run in a very very long time and I really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t push things too hard and just aimed for 15km or 75mins, whichever came first, over as much offroad terrain as I could (I wore the Merrell Trail Gloves).  In the end it was the 15km mark that came first, but only by about 2 mins.  I kept things at a pretty consistent pace (around 4:47/km) and it was only the last 4 up hill kilometers that I really slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It was really enjoyable and great to be back out on the roads early on a Sunday morning when no one is around, though that said I was quite surprised at the number of families already taking a stroll around the local lakes and ponds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll definitely be looking forward to next weekend&#39;s long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and this long run completes what has ended up being a bumper week in the mileage front: 58km in total this week which is pretty high considering I also had a 10k race on Wednesday.

This was my first and probably last running of this race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The 10k race is a very very flat two lap race around the top of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.co.uk/?ll=51.481917,-0.548587&amp;spn=0.024615,0.052314&amp;t=h&amp;z=15&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Queen Mother Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; on trail/gravel path and grass with a small section of tar as you pass the clubhouse to start your second lap.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things started well for this run.  I&#39;d had a good day at work and was in a good mood, full of energy and I felt I had a new personal best (since returning) in me that night.  I headed off to the race with plenty of time, but after a few judgement errors in my attempts to avoid traffic I ended up cutting things a bit fine and arrived at the Datchet Water Sailing club with only 10 minutes to spare.  Thankfully I was already changed so with my adrenaline levels high, I grabbed my cash and dashed up to the club house, nearly puked as I entered the clubhouse which was really hot and reeked of old chip fat (I&#39;m not a fan of the smell of old grease), paid my entrance fee and headed outside for my hurried warm up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At 19:30 promptly the 10k runners were sent on their way.  Earlier that evening there had been a mighty downpour which left the grass and path very wet with a lot of puddles.  It was also quite humid. I started well and soon got into a comfortable pace around about 3:55/km running on the grass alongside the path.  I found the gravel path a bit more slippery than the grass.  Anyway, I was chugging along nicely and then something happened... I got bored. I lost all motivation to actually push for a fast time and started to wonder if it would have been wiser to run just the 5k.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think the thing that got to me was this is really a bit of a boring race.  It&#39;s two identical flat laps with very little in the way of scenery other than the view of Windsor Castle which you could only see from one corner and the undersides of aeroplanes coming and going from Heathrow.  There wasn&#39;t much in the way of spectators either with sheep being the primary spectators around the course and a few people at the 5k/finish line.  There also weren&#39;t that many runners in the 10k so company was quite scarce.   I was so bored that I worked out that the people who would fill the top 20 places were determined within the first 2km (I was one of them).  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite my boredom and loss of motivation, I still finished in 16th place (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.purplepatchrunning.com/images/stories/QMR-WebResults10kRace3-2011.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;out of 141&lt;/a&gt;) in a time of 40:43.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Other than that, a well organised and friendly race, though the smell of grease and then sewerage as you passed the club house wasn&#39;t very nice at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t let my comments put you off this race, this race is probably perfect for those who like nice flat lapped courses.  I don&#39;t. I&#39;ve never been a big fan of lapped races and this run confirmed why I don&#39;t particularly like them. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll run this race again.  &lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Now on Google+</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/now-on-google\"/>\n   <updated>2011-07-26T11:24:41+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/now-on-google</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;For all those jumping on the Google+ bandwagon, I am now one of them and &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/+&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I am now on Google+&lt;/a&gt;.

It&#39;s a relatively close race to home, but the thing that sold it for me was free music festival in the pub gardens afterwards. I thought this would be a great opportunity for my wife to have something to do whilst I run around the &#39;burbs and it would also make the run a bit of a &quot;grand day out&quot;, which it proved to be, but we&#39;ll get onto the day&#39;s entertainment in a moment.  First the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First, the race description...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10k route will start and finish at The Cherry Tree Inn, Stoke Row, taking you through some beautiful undulating Oxfordshire Countryside. Starting at 10.30 am, you will be chip timed, have water stops, plenty of clear route signage and marshalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is pertinent as &quot;undulating&quot; is probably a little tame, but &quot;hilly&quot; is a bit too severe.  This is quite a tough run as the elevation graph from my Garmin shows...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Profile of Stoke Row 10k&quot; src=&quot;/assets/stokerow10k-profile.jpg&quot; width=&quot;595&quot; height=&quot;292&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;The greenline is the elevation - I&#39;ve scaled the image a bit to give you an idea of how it felt to me.&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there&#39;s quite a bit of climbing involved.  It is also mostly offroad which the race description doesn&#39;t mention.  It would have been good to know this in advance as I would have liked to have tackled it in my Merrells.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;The race starts on the grass outside the pub and funnels everyone across the finish line (probably so the computer can register the chip starting the race).  At the moment it&#39;s still a small race so there&#39;s plenty of space for the runners, but I think this race may increase in popularity which means they&#39;ll probably have to rethink the funnel start - possibly extend the funneling a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The grassy start is only about 50m before you break out onto the road and start heading downhill, and quite quickly too.  Before you know it, you&#39;re diverted off the road onto a wooded trail and you drop about 35m in altitude to reach the lowest point in the race just after 1km.  And then you start climbing... for about 3.5km.  There&#39;s a little table top as you cross a farmers field and then a slight dip, but nothing worth getting too excited about as you&#39;re soon climbing again. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, things ease off a bit from about 5km, where the one and only water station is.  After you&#39;ve freshened up, you&#39;ve got a good little downhill to get your legs going again and then it&#39;s moderately flat with a slight downhill feel for the next 2 and a bit kilometers. This is mostly along a shaded twin trail path alongside farmland with some lovely views.  This twin trail can be a bit challenging as you&#39;ll definitely be thinking &quot;I&#39;m sure the other path is smoother than this one?&quot;.  You&#39;ll switch and then start thinking the same thing about the path you&#39;ve just come from.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After this, you wind you way along some tarred road for a bit before dipping back into the cover of the woods for a nice fast short downhill stint.  This is a very cunning ploy as it gets you all excited before making you climb the steepest and toughest of all the hills in the race.  And to make matters worse, this steep hill is all off road on a very uneven path.  Once you pop out at the top of the hill, you need to muster all your energy to keep you going up the final tarred incline to the finish.  Unfortunately, it was at the point of popping out of the woods that we could have done with a marshal as your natural tendency was to turn right, which several people did, including the first lady.  I nearly did, but noticed another marshal further up the hill to the left so headed that way, and called back the guy who&#39;d turned right ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Being a good sport I also let him pass me again back to the finish as he would have finished ahead of me had he not gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The finish is then back on the grass outside the pub where you started.  Once crossing the line, you&#39;re handed a goody back, which this year included a coffee mug and a homemade flapjack which was very tasty, though no where near big enough for my tastes &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Several people have commented that the course was too long.  My Garmin recorded the distance at 10.4km and whilst I agree it may have been slightly over 10k, I don&#39;t think it was too much.  I can&#39;t trust my Garmin too much given the amount of time spent running under quite dense wood.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.racetimingsystems.com/public/results.aspx?raceid=1534&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official results&lt;/a&gt; for the race put me in 15th place out of 272 finishers with a race and chip time of 43:43.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there wasn&#39;t much in the way of entertainment during the race, so my wife and her parents had to keep themselves busy eating bacon sarnies and drinking tea and coffee, but from midday things started to get more entertaining.  The pub set up a limited bar outside and ran the usual bar inside.  Unfortunately, they&#39;re limited by the single till inside so the two queues for the main pub bar were out the door all day. Normal pub food was on offer from the main bar and burgers and other BBQ stuff from the outside bar.  We went prepared with a picnic so only needed drinks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As we were there from the race, we managed to nab ourselves one of the double deck chairs (what a brilliant idea) that had been set out, laid down our picnic blanket in front of it and made ourselves comfortable for the entertainment, which included, to quote the website...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carol Decker, The Lynne Butler Band, The Joint is Jumping, Kith and Kin, Bleak Angel, The International Ukulele Club of Sonning Common, The Cotton Dons, The McRobbies, Better Than Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t see everyone as we only stayed for the most famous person, Carol Decker, who happens to be the wife of the pub landlord, who came on late in the afternoon.  Once she&#39;d done her bit, we headed off home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all a very enjoyable, scenic and challenging race with great post-race entertainment making this a good day out.  The only downside for the whole day was the cold wind that kept punctuating the afternoon whilst we were enjoying the music and the long queues to get drinks from the inside bar.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">2011 Mid-Year Update</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2011-mid-year-update\"/>\n   <updated>2011-06-16T17:15:52+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2011-mid-year-update</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Well, we find ourselves in the middle of 2011, not quite slap bang in the middle, but near enough for me to provide a mid-year update.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So far my training programme has suited me well, though I will be making a slight change. Since the beginning of December last year, I&#39;ve been working on the following schedule:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Monday: run - usually a hard session&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tuesday: swim - usually about 2.5km&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wednesday: run - varies between easy and hard, depending how I feel&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thursday: full body weights session&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Friday: run - usually a longish tempo run&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Saturday and Sunday: either race or rest&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All training has been almost exclusively barefoot and when it hasn&#39;t been, as with all racing, it has been in either my Vibram Fivefinger Bikilas (road) or Merrell Trail Gloves (off-road).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now we&#39;re in race season, this format has changed slightly, only in as much as weights sessions are dropped before weekend races and after Wednesday races.  For the rest of the year, I&#39;m going to switch the swim and the weights sessions around, unless I&#39;m racing on the Wednesday in which case I won&#39;t do a weights session.  I&#39;m also going to start adding in at least one more run, probably on the weekend, to try and up my mileage a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Mileage&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Talking of mileage (or should I call it &quot;kilometerage&quot; as I do everything in metric?), last night saw me click over the 500km mark in training and racing this year.  I&#39;ve been quite good at recording my training and racing, but realised I&#39;ve not been tracking my warmups and cooldowns for races, each of which is easily 2 - 3km each, whilst I have been for training.  I&#39;m going start recording these now too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, I should tip over the 1000km mark by the end of the year.  Nothing in comparison to what a marathon runner may clock up, but certainly a long way for someone who runs mostly barefoot, is concentrating on speed and who only clocked up 668km last year. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Racing&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now with all this training and some pretty good mileage, how has the actual racing been going?  Well, actually very well.  Here are my results so far this year:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table id=&quot;bests-table&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Race&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Target Time&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Actual Time&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2011-04-23&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Reading parkrun 5k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:19:30&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:19:33&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2011-05-02&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Shinfield 10k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:43:00&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:40:42&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2011-05-15&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Woodley 10k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:42:00&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:39:42&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2011-05-22&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Stoke Row 10k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:45:00&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:43:44&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2011-06-01&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Yateley 10k Series - Race 1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:43:00&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:39:51&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2011-06-11&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Reading parkrun 5k&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:19:00&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:19:13&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;2011-06-15&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Forest Five (miles)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:32:00&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;00:32:03&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nI didn&#39;t expect to get back below 40 mins for 10k this season but so far I&#39;ve managed it twice and once so far on the Yateley 10k which is considered a bit of a harder run.  If I&#39;d thought I was capable and aiming for it, I think I could have dipped below 40 mins for my first 10k too.  That will definitely be on the cards for next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got a couple more interesting and fast races scheduled for the rest of the year so hopefully I can get a few more sub-40 10k&#39;s and hopefully that sub-19 5k.  I&#39;d love a sub-18 5k this year, but I think that&#39;s pushing it a bit.  I had originally planned a sub-18 5k this year, but now I&#39;m in full swing, I&#39;ve come to realise this is a bit of an unrealistic goal for this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Rest&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So as you can see, so far so good.   However if I want to keep this up I need to rest, and it&#39;s time for a rest.  I haven&#39;t had a rest since the week starting 14 March when my wife and I had a lovely week long break in the Lake District so I&#39;m taking the next week off to give my body a chance to recover.  The intention is to do absolutely no exercise at all, bar cycling to and from work.  If I get the urge, I may do some exercise which is not running or commuting, so either a swim, indoor rowing or possibly a weights session, just no running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and Tuesday this week saw me tick off another goal I&#39;ve had on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/2011-running-goals-and-aspirations&quot;&gt;2011 list&lt;/a&gt;, but haven&#39;t actively been gunning for: I&#39;ve dipped below 80kg in weight for the first time in years.  I&#39;m not a svelte 78.8kg. Down over 20kg since 29 Jan 2010 and down 5kg since January this year.  And best of all, I haven&#39;t been on any specific diet.  Exercise alone and my usual healthy diet has done it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, the first half of this year has gone well on the running front and hopefully the second half will be just as good, if not better.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Old Training and Racing Records</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/old-training-racing-records\"/>\n   <updated>2011-05-30T12:56:21+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/old-training-racing-records</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I commented on Twitter (which published to Facebook) that I&#39;d be gunning for a new 10k &quot;personal best since returning&quot; (PBSR) to running in the Shinfield 10k.  My cousin &quot;Liked&quot; this and then followed up the next day asking how it went as this excerpt from Facebook shows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;FBConversation.jpg&quot; src=&quot;/assets/FBConversation.jpg&quot; width=&quot;462&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My cousin has a fair point there, I shouldn&#39;t really be resetting my PBs, however my response did get me thinking... maybe I should dig out those old floppies and see if I can extract the data from the old application, Gotorun, to see what I could find.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Well, thankfully I DO still have an old laptop with a floppy drive.  It wasn&#39;t long before I had all the data off the floppies and stored in image files for manipulation later.  The next day I set to hacking my way through the database files to see if I could work out what database was used and then export the contents to CSV.  It didn&#39;t take long and thanks to the Linux and open source community, I had my data exported from the proprietary database to CSV and imported into an OpenOffice spreadsheet.  A little more tinkering and I&#39;d extracted all my races into tabs by distance so I could easily see how I&#39;d done all those years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With this data at hand I made quite a few interesting observations:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I seemed to have suffered a major data loss at some point as I know I&#39;m missing entries and a lot of the early entries had the comment &quot;Re-entry after data loss&quot; for their &quot;Notes&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It was around about March 1998 that I started getting quite good at documenting my training and racing.  Prior to that I didn&#39;t record much, though I suspect this may be due to not having discovered Gotorun at that stage or, as I mentioned above, I&#39;d had some sort of data loss.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I WALKED a half marathon with my girlfriend at the time and &quot;&lt;em&gt;Vowed never to walk a half marathon again.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; This made me smile.  I still stick to this rule.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I was quite a quick boy with the following PBs:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5km&lt;/strong&gt;: 18:35 on 26 Jan &#39;99 - I seem to only have one 5k on record and it&#39;s one of my last runs in SA.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8km&lt;/strong&gt;: 29:09 (X-Country) on 2 May &#39;98 and 30:49 (Road) on 17 Nov &#39;98&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10km&lt;/strong&gt;: 36:52 on 31 Dec &#39;98 - Yes, I raced a nite race on new year&#39;s eve.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15km&lt;/strong&gt;: 59:29 on 10 Jan &#39;99&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21.1km&lt;/strong&gt;: 1:26:31 on 20 Apr &#39;98&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32km&lt;/strong&gt;: 2:36:56 on 23 Nov &#39;97 - I know for a fact I ran this race in &#39;98 too, but this entry seems to be missing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;42.2km&lt;/strong&gt;: 4:11:13 on 22 Feb &#39;98 - My one and only marathon, used to qualify for the Two Ocean&#39;s Ultra marathon below. Terrible time due to inexperience and getting caught out by a 2-lap course.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;56km&lt;/strong&gt;: 4:48:24 on 11 Apr &#39;98&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I did record a quicker 10k time of 35:37 on 30 Jun &#39;98 but commented &quot;Short Course&quot; in my logs so I&#39;m discarding that quicker time.  I also recorded a quicker 8k time of 20:24 which I also determined to be a very short course.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All but my marathon times are really good and certainly provide some big challenges for me if I&#39;m going to get back to that level before I get too old.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those that are curious, you can take a look at the spreadsheet via &lt;a href=&quot;https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_GB&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;key=0AuOMs6ftXZbgdGllNng3cnpqcWhweHNMQUxYd21KY1E&amp;output=html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Docs here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Race Report: Woodley 10k 2011</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-woodley-10k-2011\"/>\n   <updated>2011-05-28T17:35:35+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-woodley-10k-2011</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;On Sunday 15 May 2011 I ran what I think I should start to call my local 10k race - the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.woodley10k.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Woodley 10k&lt;/a&gt;. As with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-shinfield-10k-race-2011&quot;&gt;Shinfield 10k&lt;/a&gt; race, this is also a fast and relatively flat race and I thought I may just be able to get the sub-40min 10k I just missed at Shinfield.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following a request from a colleague, this and hopefully my future &quot;first time&quot; race reports, will be a bit more in depth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Given Woodley is so close to home, and the fact that parking is limited to pretty much whatever Woodley town centre has, my wife and I cycled to the race.  Bike racks are very limited too, but nothing a long chain and a firm fence post or tree couldn&#39;t solve.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Woodley 10k starts and finishes at the town end of Memorial Recreation Ground on Headley Road in Woodley.  When we got there the kiddies&#39; 3k race was still underway and in it&#39;s final stages and quite a large crowd of runners and supporters building up around the start/finish area. For those concerned about these sort of things, there were plenty loos on offer: about 8 port-a-loos as well as those in the buildings at the recreation ground, and a fitness instructor gave a little aerobics type warm up routine just before the race started.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;The start was effectively a very wide mass congregation behind a line drawn on the grass.  There&#39;s nothing to really restrict you behind the start line, but once you cross it, you&#39;re funneled down from a width of about a football pitch to the width of a 2 lane road in about 200m thanks to orange mesh fencing on either side.  This is definitely long enough and I didn&#39;t notice any severe bunching, though I did find myself up near the front so I have no idea what it was like further back in the field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once off the field, it&#39;s a bit of a sharp turn into the rec ground drive, across two speed bumps and then out onto the road.  I can imagine this initial bit being a little tough with a large crowd.  Once on the road, it&#39;s quite flat for about the first 2.5km as you make your way through the quiet neighbourhood roads and then you get your first climb as you head up towards Bath Road.  Nothing major, but noticeable enough to drop my pace below 4:00/km for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once you reach Bath Road, you run a short section on the pavement and then turn back in towards Earley to the first water station.  It&#39;s then pretty flat and fast for the next 2km until you reach Wokingham road where you will find yourself at the highest point in the race looking as a great big long downhill towards the Showcase roundabout. According to my Garmin, we dropped about 25m in altitude over about 2.2km.  This is a great downhill to the lowest point in the race with the only thing slowing you down being the water station as you pass Station Road at about the 6km mark. It&#39;s then a slow and continual climb back up the hill back towards Woodley with another water station at about the 8km mark.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This hill is quite a toughie and took quite a chunk out of my time.  Thankfully I&#39;d built up quite a &quot;cushion&quot; in the preceding kilometres so by the time I turned back into the recreation ground road, I was still on course for a sub-40 min 10k.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The race then finishes back on the field you started on, but a little to the side of the starting straight with a little climb to give you a final burn on your legs as you sprint to the cross the line. Well, it burnt my legs as I had someone breathing down my neck for most of the long hill.  He passed me just as we entered the rec grounds, but I dug in deep and sprinted away from him on the grass to finish the race in a new &quot;PBSR&quot; (personal best since return) of 39:42.  Yes folks, I&#39;d just dipped below 40 mins for the first time in well over 12 years and I felt great.  Knackered, but absolutely delighted with myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the race is chip timed, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsystems.co.uk/ss/results/Woodley%2010K/585&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official results&lt;/a&gt; were available pretty quickly and were printed and stuck to the window of one of the buildings as they became available.  Just before leaving, I popped over to confirm my time and position. I couldn&#39;t believe it, I was on the first page of results in 23rd place (out of 596 runners).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a well earned reward, my wife and I then cycled down to our favourite pub, The Wheelright Arms, and have a big Sunday roast and a couple of beers for lunch.

The weather was warm, the skies clear and I was in the mood for some running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt; I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readingroadrunners.org/shinfield.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reading Runner&#39;s Shinfield 10k&lt;/a&gt;, my first 10k for the year.  As this is known to be a fast flat course, I also thought it would be a good chance to set myself a new &quot;since returning&quot; personal best to get the running season off to a good start.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Prior to this race, my PB was 44:26 run on the Yateley 10k course.  I&#39;ve been training a lot more carefully and consistently this year so thought a PB was definitely on the cards and aimed for what I thought was a good time of sub-43 mins.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started the race as I usually do - too fast - but for some reason it felt right and the pace - about 3:56 - 4:00/km - was very comfortable.  Given I&#39;m concentrating on 5k this year, I thought maybe it was because I&#39;ve been consistently running as faster paces in training that this faster than planned pace felt so comfortable so I stuck with it in the belief I&#39;d probably slow down dramatically at 5k or maybe 6.  Well, I did slow down on the 5th km, but not because I was tired from going too fast, but because the 5th km had the water station in it. I&#39;ve still not mastered drinking water from a cup whilst running and really miss the Miltons tasting water baggies we used to get in South Africa.  The 6th, end of the 8th and all of the 9th kilometers were slow due to a strong head wind and I finished off the 10th nice a quick.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the 8th and 9th kilometers were hard due to the wind and I like to push the last kilometer, I didn&#39;t actually check my watch for about 2.5 to 3km so had no idea how close I was to my goal of a sub-43 so imagine my surprise when I rounded the corner onto the finish straight to see the clock saying 40:30.  Huh!!! 40!!  I was shocked.  Without even trying to I&#39;d nearly run a sub-40 10k at the very beginning of the season. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the end I finished in a time of 40:42 and was as chuffed to bits. I still can&#39;t believe I managed such a great time. I definitely believe I have a sub-40 min 10k in me this season but I wasn&#39;t expecting one until at least next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As this was a race and I&#39;m now &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/2011-running-season-off-to-a-good-start&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;racing in minimalist shoes&lt;/a&gt;, I raced in my Vibram Five Finger Bikilas.  What a good idea.  Several large sections of the course had very questionable tar, some very course concrete and a long offroad section as we crossed a field between 8 and 9km.  Had I been barefoot, I think my goal of sub-43 may have been a little over optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all a brilliant start to the season.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readingroadrunners.org/Shinfield/Shinfield10kFinalResults2011.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official results&lt;/a&gt; are now out and I came 59th out of 696 runners.  Not bad at all. I&#39;ll definitely be doing this one again next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">My Roving Garmin Forerunner 405CX</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/my-roving-garmin-forerunner-405cx\"/>\n   <updated>2011-05-03T17:37:03+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/my-roving-garmin-forerunner-405cx</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to deliberately drain the battery in my Garmin Forerunner 405CX to get it to correctly reflect it&#39;s battery usage (I&#39;m sure this is a firmware bug, but Garmin don&#39;t seem to be doing anything about it), last night I set the backlight timeout to &quot;never&quot;, enabled the backlight, enabled the GPS, started the timer and place the watch on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today I imported the data (cos I&#39;m curious) and check out where my watch went when I wasn&#39;t watching...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;stationaryGPS.jpg&quot; src=&quot;/assets/stationaryGPS.jpg&quot; width=&quot;586&quot; height=&quot;426&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It managed to rack up 1.7km which is pretty impressive considering the window was closed too &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">I am Now an e-Club Runner</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/i-am-now-an-e-club-runner\"/>\n   <updated>2011-05-01T16:59:31+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/i-am-now-an-e-club-runner</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;My running is coming along nicely now and I&#39;m regularly putting in the miles.  Last year I only did 3 official races, other than the 3 free 5k Parkruns.  This year I plan on doing quite a few more, so I&#39;ve decided to join a running club.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I don&#39;t need the services of a full running club.  I have my own training programmes and goals and don&#39;t have the desire to join a proper running club and join in the club runs etc just yet.  Most of this stems from the fact most clubs I&#39;ve seen in the UK have a tendency to concentrate on the two extremes of running: marathon or track.  They do a little in between like cross-country and shorter distance road running, but don&#39;t seem to put the same emphasis on these as they do for marathons or track.  As I&#39;m doing neither extreme at the moment so I decided to join an online-only running club, or what I like to call an &quot;e-club&quot;.  I&#39;ve joined the...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fetch Everyone logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/fetch-everyone.gif&quot; width=&quot;119&quot; height=&quot;56&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/ferc.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fetch Everyone Running Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the princely sum of £16 (£15 membership + £1 PayPal admin fee) plus another £20.99 for the vest, I am now a fully fledged (well almost, I&#39;m waiting for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uka.org.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UKA&lt;/a&gt; to &quot;unlock&quot; my URN) club runner in the UK and I have the vest to go with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;So why join a club if you&#39;re not going to take advantage of the club runs etc?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; you may be thinking.  Well it&#39;s all about economics my dear Watson.  Most UKA affiliated races in the UK charge on average £2 more for non-affiliated runners than they do for affiliated runnings.  I believe this has to do with insurance. As an affiliated runner, you will be considered in county/country championship races (if you&#39;re that good).  There could be other benefits with being affiliated but I&#39;m not sure what they are. If anyone else knows, feel free to chime in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that struck me as a bit odd with the UK&#39;s licensing system, as becoming a UKA affiliated runner is essentially licensing, is how little is actually involved and how there is nothing to identify you to others that you&#39;re affiliated.  I&#39;m used to the South African system in which you register with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.athletics.org.za/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Athletics South Africa&lt;/a&gt; and in return you receive a fabric race number to sew onto your running vest.  This number is valid for a year and clearly indicates you&#39;re a licensed runner.  This has the added benefit that you don&#39;t have to pin paper numbers onto your vest at each run (you need to do this in the UK) and thus you cut down on landfill, safety pins and paper cuts.  In South Africa, as a licensed runner the only thing you get when you register for a race which doesn&#39;t provide it&#39;s own numbers like the Comrades or Two Ocean&#39;s marathons, is a little sticker in a small plastic bank bag which you pin to your shorts/shirt and then hand in at the end of the race.  If the race uses timing chips, you don&#39;t even need them, but they&#39;re often used as a manual backup.  Maybe we&#39;ll see something like this in the UK in the future, though I&#39;m doubtful as there seems to be a fair amount of animosity towards UKA and the whole registering/affiliation thing. I&#39;m not entirely sure why but I suspect it may have something to do with a change in the way the affiliation process several years ago. If someone has more details, I&#39;m intrigued to know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m now an affiliated runner and have several races lined up for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">2011 Running Season Off to a Good Start</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2011-running-season-off-to-a-good-start\"/>\n   <updated>2011-04-29T09:54:16+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2011-running-season-off-to-a-good-start</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;In January I drew up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/2011-running-goals-and-aspirations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;few goals for the year&lt;/a&gt; regarding the 5K distance, namely sub 19-min around about 2 April and then a sub 18-min 5K by the end of the year.  Well, I think I was a little over-ambitious with these goals.  The 2 April deadline came and went without a run.  Problems on the home front meant there was no way I was going to be running that weekend, so I delayed my attempt.  In training I soon realised I wasn&#39;t like to get sub 19-min this early in the season either, so I settled for around about 19:30 for the start of the season and we&#39;ll see how I get on from there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, last Saturday I kicked off my 2011 season in fine form.  It was a gloriously sunny day and I headed down the road for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/default&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reading Parkrun&lt;/a&gt;, my first for the year.  The weather was good and the turnout was incredible.  At 9am we were sent on our way and I soon fell into the groove and had a very enjoyable run, in my Merrell Trail Gloves.  I&#39;d actually forgotten I&#39;d set myself a mini-goal of 19:30, but ended up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/results/weeklyresults?runSeqNumber=81&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;finishing 10th over all in a new PB of 19:33&lt;/a&gt; anyway.  Not bad if I say so myself.  I definitely need to work on my speed, overall cardio levels and race pacing but I&#39;m still way fitter and better than I was this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things are going to be a little different this year on the racing front too: I&#39;m going to be racing in shoes, well actually in Vibram Five Finger Bikilas on the road and Merrell Trail Gloves offroad.  I&#39;ve come to this decision for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;English councils and the Highways Agency are currently in a rather frugal phase when it comes to repairing and maintaining roads. Potholes aren&#39;t repaired until someone loses their car in it and the current surfacing policy seems to be spray some sticky stuff onto the tar that&#39;s already there, throw some black stones at it and see what sticks. As a result, the roads are effectively big long stony paths with a nice build up of loose stones towards the curbs.  This is a nightmare to run on barefoot and quashes any hopes of a good time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I plan on spending a lot more time running offroad.  I find running offroad very enjoyable and way more relaxing than running on the road. I&#39;ve also got my eye on several races that are either entirely offroad or have sections which are offroad and these are generally not very conducive to barefoot running.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m gunning for some good times this year.  I&#39;ve got a good year&#39;s worth of training and running under my belt now, so I think I can start pushing things a bit and aiming for the times I used to run.  I don&#39;t expect to be anywhere near my all-time personal bests, but I am hoping for some good times, and I don&#39;t want these attempts ruined by encountering one of the above issues.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I will however continue to do most of my training barefoot.  Offroad training runs and recovery runs will likely involve shoes, but that&#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Monday sees my first 10K of the season on the rather flat (apparently) Shinfield 10k coarse.  As it&#39;s apparently a flat one and I&#39;ll be running in the Bikilias, I&#39;m hoping for a good time to start the season off with. We&#39;ll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Motivational Email</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/motivational-email\"/>\n   <updated>2011-04-17T22:59:10+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/motivational-email</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I enjoy blogging.  I like to share my views and opinions and knowledge, but more importantly, I like to inspire, especially when it comes to running.  The other day I received this great email from &lt;a href=&quot;http://warhippo.co.uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jon&lt;/a&gt; which I thought others considering barefoot or minimalist running may find interesting and motivational...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Colin&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just found your site (barefootrunner.co.uk) whilst searching for flat running shoes and have enjoyed what I&#39;ve read.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Much like you I started running many moons ago, suffered shin splints and knee problems so gave up running, got into weights and then tried running every few years (only to find the injuries kept coming back).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A year or so ago, my wife started running, which gave me a push to try again - only this time I was armed with all the powers of the internet : ) I learnt about persistence running and decided to change how I ran and I&#39;ve not looked back since - I now run mid / forefoot without any heel strike. I only run twice a week (both times off road, one 3 miler in the hills and one 4 miler on sand dunes). I wear a pair of hi-tecs with hardly any heel and virtually no cushioning at all (it&#39;s taken me several months to get to the point where I can run without the usual padding but it&#39;s so much been worth it).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve taken it slowly as I herniated a disc in my spine 3 years ago which has taught me a lot about going steady and building on solid foundations. At the time, all the medical professionals told me that I had to give up weights but after a dose of hard graft I&#39;m still training with weights and my back is getting stronger all the time. I&#39;m certain that running has helped me get through this nasty injury and strangely, going through the injury has helped to teach me to be more adaptive. Consequently I am back running when before the injury I would have simply given up on it and said that &quot;I&#39;m not built for running&quot; - how many times have you heard that?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I love barefoot hiking so barefoot running is something I&#39;m working towards (or at the very least barefoot running technique combined with barefoot running shoes).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, keep up the good work!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers - Jon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And then in a separate email in response to the one I sent in response to the one above...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like your goal setting page. I believe that setting (and attaining) progressively more difficult goals is very much the road to success - but I never forget to reward myself upon attaining them (achieving a goal is not always enough of a reward in itself). My running goal is far less specific than yours, since I&#39;m not interested in competing (not that I currently could - LOL), all I want to achieve this year running-wise is to be able to run in the hills for an hour without it being too difficult. It&#39;s a very broad goal but with my injury I&#39;ve found that broader goals are far less restrictive - but that&#39;s just me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One thing I didn&#39;t mention was that in the last year or so I&#39;ve gone from just shy of 14 stone to 12 stone and the only thing I&#39;ve changed about my routine is swapping one of my 45 minute weights sessions for a 30 minute running session each week (and missing second breakfast which was a tin of rice pudding). Have I lost muscle? Probably some but since I continue to get stronger (I can deadlift 200 kilos, squat 140 kilos, bench 110 kilos and do bodyweight chins + 60 kilos) I don&#39;t really care - I&#39;m done with looking big for the sake of looking big - functionality over form is far more my style now and running is an essential part of that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&#39;m waffling, I&#39;ll let you know how I get on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for sharing your experiences and for letting me post them here.

Thankfully, I had a bumper week this week on the mileage front, so I can take things a bit easier next week.  A series of long gentle runs should be sufficient to allow my body to recover after last week&#39;s efforts, provided the heat doesn&#39;t kill me first.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My diet goes to pot.  Restaurant food just isn&#39;t the same as home cooked food and often contains way more calories and &quot;bad stuff&quot;.  I also love the opportunity to try new food when in foreign countries (especially when I&#39;m expensing my meals &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; ) and I find I turn to the plethora of junk foods and sweets we don&#39;t get in the UK just to see what they&#39;re like.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not this time.  This time I&#39;m making a concerted effort to keep my diet in check.  No fast food and where possible no chips, potatoes, rice or bread.  I&#39;ve chosen these four ingredients to concentrate on as they are the fillers almost every restaurant uses to fill their plates.  This inevitably leads to over eating and by the end of the week, the last thing I want to eat is chips, potatoes, rice or bread.  Instead I&#39;m asking for substitutes: extra veggies, beans, salad or nothing and I&#39;ll add a side salad. Oh yes, and NO fizzy pop.  The US has gargantuan sized soft drinks and in this heat I can easily see myself gulping loads of fizzy pop, especially Mountain Dew and Coke, if I&#39;m not careful.  Instead I&#39;m having beer (they&#39;re smaller than in the UK) and water only.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If I&#39;m diligent with this, I think I may actually lose weight this week, eat better and feel better for it.  I&#39;m also hoping it will help with the jetlag and accordingly I&#39;ve set it as a mini-goal for myself.  If I don&#39;t lose any weight, so what, but if I do I suspect I&#39;ll feel better in the long run than I normally do when cross-timezone travelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update - 19 April 2011:&lt;/strong&gt; I can confirm I did indeed lose weight whilst travelling on business.  Weighed myself today and clocked in at 80.7, down from 81.7.  I think this is the first time I&#39;ve lost weight whilst travelling, especially to the US.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Log On To Help Prevent Injuries</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/log-on-to-help-prevent-injuries\"/>\n   <updated>2011-02-24T16:37:44+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/log-on-to-help-prevent-injuries</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Are you a runner - barefoot isn&#39;t essential?

Some of it I will have to take with a pinch of salt, but after today&#39;s little experiment, I&#39;ll certainly be trying out a few of the ideas in this book.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As has become habit as part of my current training programme, I swim on Tuesdays - I&#39;m paying for a gym membership with a pool, so I&#39;m going to blooming well use it.  Prior to today, my sessions comprised of 80 lengths of 25 meters broken up into sets of 10 lengths alternating crawl and breaststroke.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The alternation was required because my crawl has never been my strong point and I was finding completing 10 lengths pretty tiring and hard.  I&#39;m well trained in breaststroke as it was my primary stroke when I competed at school so it&#39;s a breeze in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;One of the chapters in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0091939526?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0091939526&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The 4-Hour Body&lt;/a&gt; is &quot;&lt;em&gt;How I Learnt to Swim Effortlessly in 10 Days&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.  It&#39;s not a very long chapter - in fact Tim Ferris, the author actually published the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/08/13/total-immersion-how-i-learned-to-swim-effortlessly-in-10-days-and-you-can-too/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;entire chapter on his blog years ago&lt;/a&gt; - but it provides enough information to get you heading in the right direction: that of learning how to swim crawl using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Immersion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Total Immersion&lt;/a&gt; method. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing crawl is my weakness, I read the chapter and followed up by investigating on the Internet.  One of the links Tim provides in the book is to this video...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/rJpFVvho0o4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a word: Wow!!! I was amazed at how graceful this guy was swimming with such little effort and at quite a pace too.  By comparison, I must look like a flailing idiot who&#39;s only just keeping himself from drowning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after re-reading the chapter and watching all the videos I could find on the topic, I hit the pool this morning for my first session of Total Immersion crawl.  Well, to say I&#39;m impressed is an understatement.  I&#39;m amazed. Gob-smacked and downright impressed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I took my time to make sure I performed everything as I had seen in the various videos and in the book and soon got into the swing of things.  Before I knew it, I was on my 20th lap, still doing crawl, and I didn&#39;t want to stop.  What was a relatively little change has made a dramatic improvement and I easily completed 100 lengths (2.5km) in 49 minutes WITHOUT having to stop (except to get water out of my goggles and to hit the button on my watch) and without having to do any breaststroke.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My times were also dramatically improved. To give you an idea of how much, here are my 10 lap splits from a recent swim (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/training-log-view.php?id=6103196&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;25 Jan 2011&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/training-log-view.php?id=6154793&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;today&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table style=&quot;border:0;margin:0 auto;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;BEFORE&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;AFTER&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;vertical-align:top&quot;&gt;Crawl: 5:56 (leaky goggles)&lt;br /&gt;\nBreast: 5:34&lt;br /&gt;\nCrawl: 5:37&lt;br /&gt;\nBreast: 5:29&lt;br /&gt;\nCrawl: 5:42&lt;br /&gt;\nBreast: 5:33&lt;br /&gt;\nCrawl: 5:48&lt;br /&gt;\nBreast: 5:34&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;4:53&lt;br /&gt;\n4:55&lt;br /&gt;\n4:59&lt;br /&gt;\n4:52&lt;br /&gt;\n5:00 (leaky goggles)&lt;br /&gt;\n5:00 (leaky goggles)&lt;br /&gt;\n4:53&lt;br /&gt;\n4:56&lt;br /&gt;\n4:59&lt;br /&gt;\n4:57&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, that&#39;s well over 30 seconds improvement per 250m in 2 weeks and I&#39;m pretty sure that improvement has nothing to do with improved fitness.  I think this is all down to an improved stroke.  I had actually only intended on doing 2km, but as I got there so quickly and easily, I threw in 20 more lengths and I think I could have carried on for a fair bit more had I the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My stroke is nowhere near as smooth as in the video, and I kick a bit more than he does, but it&#39;s certainly much better than it was. I&#39;m very impressed with this and am looking forward to next week&#39;s swim already.  All I need to do now is try and hone things a bit, improve my pace and learn an efficient tumble turn and I&#39;ll be zooming up and down the pool like a demon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m still deciding on what I&#39;ll do next from this book, but I&#39;ll certainly keep you posted on what I do do and how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Happy 1st Barefoot Anniversary To ME</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/happy-1st-barefoot-anniversary-to-me\"/>\n   <updated>2011-02-04T12:56:05+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/happy-1st-barefoot-anniversary-to-me</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Oooops, I&#39;ve just realised I missed my own 1st barefoot anniversary. So...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;font-weight:bold;font-size:40px;line-height:1em;&quot;&gt;Happy 1st Barefoot Anniversary to ME&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, 1 February was the big day.  A whole year since I made the big decision to run completely barefoot as much as possible.  I&#39;ve not run all my runs and races barefoot in that time due to sensitivity, rough terrain, extreme temperatures, shoe reviews or because I really didn&#39;t feel like it, but well over 95% of my running has been completely barefoot since then.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a great year and certainly a massive learning experience.  The muscles in my feet are stronger than they&#39;ve ever been.  The skin on the bottom of my feet is becoming more and more like tough leather. My form is good and I know my running is the best it&#39;s been since I moved over to the UK.  The last year hasn&#39;t all been a bed of roses, I did suffer what was probably a &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/tofp-probably-stress-fracture&quot;&gt;stress fracture in my 3rd metatarsal&lt;/a&gt; back in July, which in hindsight was probably due to the problems I&#39;ve had with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/finally-sorting-my-back-out&quot;&gt;right sacroiliac joint&lt;/a&gt;.  Since visiting the physio and consequently paying a lot more attention to my core, I&#39;ve had no problems with my feet and my right hip and lower back are considerably better. I think my running may have also improved as a result of the extra attention I&#39;ve been paying to my core.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I said back in January, my goals for this year are to continue running barefoot as much as possible and to concentrate on the 5km distance.  I&#39;ll still be doing 10k races, but mainly for fun and training.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just as well my wife has suggested a visit to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thewheelwrightsarms.co.uk/home.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;favourite pub&lt;/a&gt; (they always have on at least 6 real ales ;-p) for a few bevvies tonight.  Think I may have to dedicate one as a celebratory drink. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers everybody.  I think this next year is going to be a good one.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">The Wheatsheaf Pub Doesn&#39;t Like Bare Feet in Their Garden</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/wheatsheaf-doesnt-like-bare-feet-in-garden\"/>\n   <updated>2011-01-23T18:51:17+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/wheatsheaf-doesnt-like-bare-feet-in-garden</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Sign spotted at the foot of the steps into the Wheatsheaf Pub last summer when my wife and I went for a walk around Virginia Water (I&#39;ve only just found it after trawling through all my photos I&#39;ve taken but not done anything with)...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/1156589096_WtDSR-L.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Footwear must be worn in the garden&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I can understand the need for tops at all times (some people don&#39;t like looking at boobies) and shoes in the pub, but what&#39;s so wrong with toasting my piggies in the garden?

I&#39;ve done this in the past, but that&#39;s changing this year as I&#39;ve actually thought about it and put the plan into action already.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;I don&#39;t have many running goals for this year, but the ones I do have, I&#39;ve broken up into two categories: hard goals and soft goals.  Hard goals are those I&#39;m actively training for.  The ones I really want to achieve.  The soft goals are the &quot;nice to haves&quot; and in theory if I achieve the hard goals, I&#39;m likely to hit the soft goals without much more effort. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Hard Goals&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Run a sub-19 minute 5km, barefoot, by the end of the first week of April&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Run a sub-18 minute 5km, barefoot, by the end of the year&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;NOT to race any distance higher than 10 miles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These are pretty ambitious goals, but certainly not unrealistic.  My current PB (ignoring my PBs from years ago) for &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/parkrun-two-and-a-pb-too&quot;&gt;5k is 19:41&lt;/a&gt; and that was clocked last year in what I&#39;d say was a far from optimal fitness level.  Knocking 41 seconds off in 3 months shouldn&#39;t be too hard if I train sensibly - it&#39;s about quality, not quantity.  Once I&#39;ve got below 19 minutes, 8 months to knock off another minute, whilst tough, should be possible.  Of course, if I fly through the 18 minute mark, I will re-assess my goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Soft Goals&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Run a sub-40 minute 10km by the end of the year&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lose at least 5kg in body fat (My current mass is 84kg)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This year is all about the 5km distance for me.  Most runners I know dismiss the 5km as just fun-run stuff, and whilst I agree it is commonly associated with fun runs, it is also a distance that is all about speed, without being track-based.  Speed is not something you&#39;ll have forever and is probably one of the hardest things in running to get back once you&#39;ve lost it.  It&#39;s also the one thing every runner wishes they had more of.  Concentrating on the 5k distance will hone my speed which will then transfer into much quicker 10k (and longer) races later on.  Concentrating on 5k will also allow me to improve my form at speed and allow me to &quot;master&quot; the distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not entirely neglecting longer distances, I&#39;m just not concentrating on them and will be allowing my 5k training to carry me through and improve my 10k times.  I&#39;m not running any further than 10 miles / 16km as I think this takes me too far away from concentrating on the 5km distance.  I also don&#39;t want to be bitten by the long-and-slow bug just yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;So How Am I Going To Do It?&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m taking a full-body &quot;quality not quantity&quot; approach with emphasis on running and core strength.  My training program is broken down as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday:&lt;/strong&gt; Run + core exercises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday:&lt;/strong&gt; Alternate non-impact cardio - primarily swimming, but rowing and cycling may be thrown in too&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday:&lt;/strong&gt; Run + core exercises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday:&lt;/strong&gt; Full body weights session + core exercises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday:&lt;/strong&gt; Run + core exercises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday &amp; Sunday:&lt;/strong&gt; Rest, though I may throw in a recovery run here and there if I feel the need or I&#39;m in the mood&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All runs will have a purpose.  No idle running for the sake of clocking up miles.  I&#39;ve deliberately NOT specified what running training I&#39;ll do on each day as this WILL change as my programme changes and as my mood changes and how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Where possible/plausible/desirable, all runs will be barefoot.  The only times I anticipate I won&#39;t run barefoot is for long recovery runs - &lt;em&gt;recovery&lt;/em&gt; means all of me must recover, including the soles of my feet if they&#39;re feeling a little tender - off-road runs, run in sub-zero temperatures and races on unknown routes or obviously rough terrain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been following this programme more or less to the word for about 5 weeks in total now: 2 weeks in December before the Crimbo hols and 3 weeks in January (I&#39;m part way through the 3rd week now) and it&#39;s definitely well within my capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If I stick to it, am sensible and listen to my body, I think I should be able to attain all of my hard goals.  I&#39;ll certainly let you all know if I do or don&#39;t.  Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll get to see the south-side of a 17 minute 5k before the year&#39;s out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also added the hard goals to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/a&gt; page so I can tick them off and will be constantly reminded of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Barefoot Cufflinks</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-cufflinks\"/>\n   <updated>2011-01-19T18:37:31+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-cufflinks</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Look what my wonderful wife got me for Christmas...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/1156577556_e5PVd-S.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Barefoot Cufflinks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think these are terrific.

Well how about taking them on a barefoot holiday.  Yes, a barefoot holiday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just discovered there are these really cool &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barfusspark.info/en/park.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;barefoot parks&lt;/a&gt; all over Europe (predominantly in German and Austria) that are open to the public and offer you the opportunity to go for barefoot walks. These parks actually encouraged you to take off your shoes and get one with nature (you&#39;ll have to go elsewhere if you want to really get one with nature &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; ) and feel the earth below your feet, feel the cold water between your toes and the pebbles under your feet as you walk through streams and rivers.  Some even offer playground areas specially designed for being bare foot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What a great idea, and what a great way to get the whole family involved in your new found passion for going barefoot.  Who knows, maybe after one of these holidays your wife or one of your kids will want to join you on one of your barefoot runs, barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">2010 in Summary</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2010-in-summary\"/>\n   <updated>2010-12-31T23:59:55+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/2010-in-summary</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Diing doong diing dooong... diing doong diing dooong.. yes folks, Big Ben is starting to chime out 2010 and chime in 2011 so it&#39;s time for my annual summary of the year gone by.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This year started off with a bang with &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/todays-run&quot;&gt;9 inches of snow&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.co.uk/introducing-lara-nieve-seymour&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;birth of my daughter&lt;/a&gt;.  Sadly, this delight was soon turned to immense sadness as my little girl was born with a heart defect and &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/back-online&quot;&gt;sadly didn&#39;t make it through surgery&lt;/a&gt;.  It was during the tough time of waiting for my daughter to grow big enough for surgery that I switched to predominantly running completely barefoot and I haven&#39;t looked back.  I still go out for the occasional run in shoes of sorts, but most of my runs are now barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Publicity&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2010 saw quite a huge rise in popularity and interest in barefoot running with &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/book-born-to-run-by-christopher-mcdougall&quot;&gt;Born to Run&lt;/a&gt; becoming quite a motivator for a lot of people along with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/my-thoughts-on-the-lieberman-paper&quot;&gt;Lieberman Paper&lt;/a&gt; - this last post even saw me getting a comment from the king of barefooters - &lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barefoot Ken Bob&lt;/a&gt;.  This interest and enthusiasm was further amplified by the introduction of the first pair of barefoot-like shoes specifically designed for running when Terra Plana released the Evo.  I was lucky enough to be provided a pair for &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/review-terra-plana-vivobarefoot-evo-running-shoes&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;.  This year also saw other manufacturers release their own &quot;barefoot&quot; running shoes, though I&#39;ve not had the privilege to try any of these yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We also saw several prominent barefoot runners release books, including Michael Sandler&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/getting-michael-sandlers-barefoot-running-book-in-the-uk&quot;&gt;Barefoot Running&lt;/a&gt; book (note to self: I still need to write my review on this book) and Jason Robillard&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/book-review-the-barefoot-running-book-by-jason-robillard&quot;&gt;The Barefoot Running Book&lt;/a&gt;.  There have been other books, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re really much more than jumping on the bandwagon type of books.  Next year however will see what I&#39;m hoping will be the &quot;Bible&quot; of barefoot running: Barefoot Ted&#39;s book - &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-ken-bob-s-running-barefoot-book&quot;&gt;The Complete Book of Barefoot Running&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This year I was also quoted in two printed articles. First was an &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/run-like-your-ancestors&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; for the University of the West of England&#39;s student paper The Western Eye and the second saw Runner&#39;s World quote me in a pretty one-sided (against) &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/naked-truth-about-barefoot-running-runners-world-uk-april-2010&quot;&gt;article on barefoot running&lt;/a&gt;. It was nice to see my name in print and good to see the likes of Runner&#39;s World start to take note.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Racing&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When things started to warm up in the spring, my running really started to pick up too.  I ran three of the Reading Parkruns completely barefoot.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/reading-parkrun-barefoot&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; was a taster to see how I would get on.  Once bitten by the racing bug, I ran my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/parkrun-two-and-a-pb-too&quot;&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; a week later and smashed my previous time and dipped under 20 mins to finish with a time of 19:41.  My &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-reading-parkrun-three&quot;&gt;third&lt;/a&gt; run was several weeks later and also a sub-20 finish time, though not quite as fast as my PB.  Between the 2nd and 3rd Parkruns I also ran my first road race in the UK, &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/yateley-10k-series-race-1-completed-barefoot&quot;&gt;the Yateley 10k&lt;/a&gt;, and I ran this completely barefoot too in a time of 46:05.  A month later I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-yateley-10k-series-2010-race-2&quot;&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; in the series in a new PB of 44:43. Between the two 10k races I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-the-forest-five-2010&quot;&gt;Forest Five&lt;/a&gt; but as it was offroad and my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/racing-offroad-research-it-first&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; deemed it unsuitable for barefoot, I ran this in my Vibrams.  This was a lovely race and one I&#39;ll definitely be doing again next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Injuries&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, all did NOT go well on the running front this year.  During the second Yateley 10K I managed to really &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/tofp-probably-stress-fracture&quot;&gt;hurt my left foot&lt;/a&gt; with what I suspect may have been a stress fracture.  This took me out of action for 6 weeks.  Not long after returning to running after this forced rest I finally sought advice on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/finally-sorting-my-back-out&quot;&gt;recurring pain I was getting in my lower back and right sacroiliac joint&lt;/a&gt;.  My first visit to the physio quickly identified the problem and also the most probably cause for my foot injury: I had a hypo-mobile right sacroiliac joint caused by excessive use of my abs, back muscles and hamstrings for stability rather than using my glutes and core muscles. This immobility is likely to have caused over compensation elsewhere which in turn is likely to have led to odd foot placement or twisting when running.  Thankfully, after a lot of core exercises designed to strengthen and engage my core muscles, I am now pain free and I think my running has improved too. The only thing is I need to keep doing these exercises regularly to ensure my core remains strong and I remain painfree, but as these aren&#39;t too long or intensive this can easily be done as part of my warm-ups and cool-downs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Training&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My training went very well, especially when I start of following a programme, sort of.  I didn&#39;t rigidly follow the programmes in the &quot;Brain Training for Runners&quot; book, but used it as a guide for my own running.  Next year I plan to do the same thing, but more actively and schedule in some target races so I can see how I&#39;m progressing.  I&#39;ve also now joined the local David Lloyd gym and even though I &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-in-david-lloyd-gyms&quot;&gt;can&#39;t go barefoot in the gym&lt;/a&gt;, I plan on using the gym facilities to the full extent to cross-train to improve my running.  This year also saw me becoming a bit more hard-core with some &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-cold-winter-run&quot;&gt;barefoot runs in the cold&lt;/a&gt;. Snow and Christmas has limited the number of these, but not significantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A quick look at my training log totals for the year is also quite telling (figures are in Km):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Training Log Totals - 2010&quot; src=&quot;/assets/TrainingLogTotals-2010.jpg&quot; width=&quot;530&quot; height=&quot;80&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The high mileage in April and May along with my hip problems are likely to have led to the injury in July and the subsequent decrease in mileage for the subsequent months as I tried to ensure I didn&#39;t do too much too soon.  October was an exception as I went on holiday and there was no running on this holiday and December, well Christmas and snow is all I need to say here. Not a bad total either. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all, 2010 has been quite a busy year for me.  Lets hope 2011 is a better year with more running, more racing, more happiness and less injuries.  Time to draw up my list of goals for 2011 too.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Foot Stickers</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/foot-stickers\"/>\n   <updated>2010-12-30T13:36:49+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/foot-stickers</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Now this is an interesting concept: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/12/foot-stickers-the-most-minimal-sneakers-around/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;foot stickers&lt;/a&gt;...  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Foot Stickers&quot; src=&quot;/assets/FootStickers.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why wear a whole shoe when all you need is a little protection on the bottom of your feet? A great idea, though I think it may not be particularly practical to implement, especially for outdoor use. You&#39;d need to invent some pretty impressive sticky stuff that is water and sweat proof and yet easily removable from the skin without the need for solvents etc.  Ideally this would need to be re-usable, though not essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It would also need to come off fingers easily so you could actually let go of your foot stickers once you&#39;ve taken them off your feet &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Merry Christmas 2010</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/merry-christmas-2010\"/>\n   <updated>2010-12-25T08:18:57+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/merry-christmas-2010</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Barefoot Christmas&quot; src=&quot;/assets/BarefootChristmas.png&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; height=&quot;366&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Have a fabulous and merry barefoot Christmas&lt;/h2&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Yoga Stick-E Socks</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/yoga-stick-e-socks\"/>\n   <updated>2010-12-21T14:32:20+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/yoga-stick-e-socks</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Look what I happened to stumble across on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidlloydshop.co.uk/store/yoga-pilates-mats/yoga/products/yoga-stick-e-socks/default.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Lloyd &quot;shop&quot;&lt;/a&gt; website:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Yoga Stick-E Socks&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Stick_e_socks.jpg&quot; width=&quot;273&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently the &quot;&lt;em&gt;exposed toes&lt;/em&gt;&quot; are &quot;&lt;em&gt;for gripping and maintaining that barefoot feeling&quot; and they &quot;protect against fungus and communicable diseases&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, except those that are transmitted via the ends of your toes - watch out for them, they&#39;re the deadliest &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-in-david-lloyd-gyms&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;manager of the gym will allow me to wear these in the gym in locations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than the yoga classes.  They sell them, so they must be acceptable.  Not sure I&#39;ll spend over £15 for a pair of socks though, especially when these funky coloured &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toesocks.co.uk/Knee-high_Stripy_Rainbow-p-907.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;yoga toe socks&lt;/a&gt; are half the price (I got my wife a pair and she loves them) and way more fun.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Given how popular yoga and pilates are and how &quot;in tune&quot; they are with being barefoot, I&#39;m surprised gyms are still so iffy about being barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Going Barefoot in David Lloyd Gyms</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-in-david-lloyd-gyms\"/>\n   <updated>2010-12-18T14:03:08+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-in-david-lloyd-gyms</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;With Sun Microsystems&#39; recent acquisition by Oracle, I&#39;ve found myself moving offices, which thankfully is closer to home.  As I would no longer be going anywhere near Camberley, I cancelled my old gym membership at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foundationfitness.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Foundation Fitness&lt;/a&gt; (free plug: this is a great, friendly and very affordable small gym in Sandhurst that I would have continued being a member of if it were practical) and waited to see what the Oracle offering is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oracle&#39;s offering is a heavily discounted corporate membership with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; gym across the road.  Normally David Lloyd is way too expensive for my liking, but with the corporate discount, it&#39;s no more expensive than what I used to pay for Foundation Fitness, so I signed up from 1 December.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Between 1 December and 9 December, I went to the gym 6 times and on all 6 occasions I was barefoot for pretty much most of the time I was in the gym.  I performed all my warm ups for running and swimming barefoot, I performed by cool downs barefoot and even performed my weights session barefoot (my squats are much better barefoot) without a single person approaching me or even commenting.  Yes, I got some strange looks, but that&#39;s expected when people aren&#39;t used to something new.  Anyway, that was until the 9th.  During my weights session that day, I was approached by one of the instructors and told that her manager had told her to come tell me to put shoes on as it&#39;s &quot;policy&quot;.  I questioned this policy but she couldn&#39;t tell me anything about this policy other than her manager told her.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to cause too much of a scene, not wanting to delay my training and clear in the knowledge she wasn&#39;t going to be able to help me further - obviously a policy the general staff aren&#39;t too aware of - I obliged and grabbed my Vibrams from the changerooms and continued my workout, but I wasn&#39;t going to let this one lie.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;On returning to the office I trawled through the Ts &amp; Cs and documents I&#39;d been given and I couldn&#39;t find any rule or policy preventing me from going barefoot so I thought I&#39;d email the branch&#39;s general manager to find out more.  I couldn&#39;t find a direct email address, but I did find a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/home/clubcontact/faqs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contact form&lt;/a&gt; in which I posted the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been a member now for just over a week and have attended the gym on 6 separate occasions, each time barefoot. I am a full time barefoot runner and attempt to do as much of my exercises barefoot so as to continue enhancing and improving my barefoot running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today I was approached for the first time by one of the instructors, [ removed to protect the person&#39;s identity &lt;!-- Bethan Thompson --&gt; ], and was told her manager had told her to come tell me to put shoes on as it&#39;s policy. Unfortunately, she could not tell me where this is documented or why such a policy exists.  She did however confirm that Vibram Five Finger &quot;shoes&quot; were acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So with this in mind, I&#39;ve got a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1.  Where is it documented that all members should wear shoes in the gym?  I may have missed something in the documentation I was provided on joining.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2.  What is the substantiation for this policy?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3.  If this policy exists, what is the procedure to get it reconsidered?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4.  I&#39;m happy to abide by this policy if it exists, but what about situations where I go out for a run barefoot and then enter the main gym to perform my cool down stretches prior to going for a shower?  Am I expected to put on my Vibram Five Fingers for the 5 - 10 mins I&#39;ll be cooling down?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More and more research is proving the benefits of performing exercises and running barefoot, and in fact I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of your own classes encourage  being barefoot. It would be a shame for an organisation that prides itself in being knowledgeable and up-to-date on fitness topic to be left enforcing outdated and unsubstantiated policies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not trying to make waves or be belligerent, I&#39;m just keen to found out more about this policy. Given David Lloyd actively advertise they&#39;re open to changes in policy based on member feedback, I&#39;m eager to see such a policy documented, substantiated, changed or revoked.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&lt;br /&gt;\nColin\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not long after submitting my form, I received a response confirming receipt of my email and that it would be forwarded to the sports and general managers for review on Monday as they were both on annual leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Much to my surprise I received a call from the sports manager &lt;!-- Gareth --&gt; at about 15:30 on Friday 10 December and we discussed this a bit.  Apparently the policy about wearing shoes falls under the following very vague and general term in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/static/downloads/DL-Members-Hndbk.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Member&#39;s Handbook&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part B - Terms and conditions of use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n1. General health and safety&lt;br /&gt;\n[ ... ]&lt;br /&gt;\ng) While you are at the club, you are expected to behave and dress appropriately, respectfully and politely at all times. We can prevent you entering the club, you to leave or cancel your membership if we think that your behaviour or appearance is not suitable\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s worth pointing out the printed version isn&#39;t quite so appallingly written:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part B - Terms and conditions of use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n1. General health and safety&lt;br /&gt;\n[ ... ]&lt;br /&gt;\ng) While you are at the club, you are expected to behave appropriately, respectfully and politely, and dress appropriately (for example by not wearing your swimsuit in the club room), at all times. We can prevent you from entering the club, or ask you to leave if we think that your behaviour or appearance is not suitable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the sports manager then went on to admit it was a very vague term and also tried to explain that they don&#39;t use pins, but if I accidentally stood on one, they&#39;d be responsible.  I pointed out that Vibrams don&#39;t offer much protection from this &quot;accident&quot; to which he responded &quot;but they&#39;re still a form of footwear&quot;.  He admitted that dropping a weight on my foot wouldn&#39;t really be different whether I was wearing a shoe or not.   I then asked what about things like pilates and yoga classes and the Power Plate device in which barefoot is often encouraged.  The sport manager then pointed out that they don&#39;t encourage barefoot on the Power Plate (I acknowledged I&#39;ve not seen it at Reading, but I do know other sources suggesting it) and &quot;classes take place in studios&quot;, which seemed like a bit of a roundabout way of saying &quot;they&#39;re exempt because no one can see them&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The sports manager then seemed to become in a bit of a hurry and I definitely got the feeling that he was trying to speed up the conversation to finish off quickly.  He confirmed that the general manager would be in on Monday and that he&#39;d discuss it with him in more detail then.  He confirmed that they don&#39;t like to get in the way of members&#39; beliefs and passions and that as I clearly am quite dedicated and passionate about being barefoot, one of the things he would discuss with the general manager would be the idea of me signing a disclaimer absolving David Lloyd of any responsibility for any injury I may incur due to not wearing shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I said I&#39;d be more than happy to sign such a disclaimer and I looked forward to his or the general manager&#39;s call on Monday, but if signing a disclaimer was not an option, I&#39;d be expecting an answer to my fourth question regarding warming up and cooling down before and after my runs etc which I currently do barefoot.  The sport manager hurriedly said they&#39;ll cover this all on Monday too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Monday I went to the gym as normal and obeyed the rules and wore my Vibrams whilst in the gym.  I think I may have been spotted by the general manager who probably thought &quot;&lt;em&gt;Oh yes, I needed to respond to that email from that guy who doesn&#39;t wear shoes&lt;/em&gt;&quot; as on my return from the gym I had the following email in my inbox:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subject: \tRE: General Enquiry - from davidlloyd.co.uk&lt;br /&gt;\nDate: \tMon, 13 Dec 2010 12:43:58 +0000&lt;br /&gt;\nFrom: \tMatthew Bridle&lt;br /&gt;\nTo: \tColin Seymour&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dear Colin,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your email regarding barefoot running in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I fully understand your position to barefoot running in the gym and you&lt;br /&gt;\nare obviously very passionate about this discipline.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The main reason we ask all members to where appropriate footwear is&lt;br /&gt;\npurely for hygiene reasons. As I’m sure you are aware the feet can carry&lt;br /&gt;\nmany fungal infections and are more susceptible to abrasions or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;\nWhilst I am not for one minute suggesting that you have this is the case&lt;br /&gt;\nfor you, I hope you understand I have to keep the rules consistent for&lt;br /&gt;\nall 3,500 club members.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It does state in the terms and conditions that you must dress&lt;br /&gt;\nappropriately and this is then expanded in the gym notices to say that&lt;br /&gt;\nfootwear must be worn.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I’m sure you can appreciate we are a large company and the rules for&lt;br /&gt;\nall clubs have to be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kind Regards&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Matthew Bridle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, it&#39;s nice I got a response though it&#39;s clear he didn&#39;t actually read my email properly. I was also very disappointed, though not surprised, that his response was one of the two fob-off responses I predicted I would get.  As is common with any query about policies, people who: don&#39;t know, don&#39;t want to know, or couldn&#39;t give a monkeys will always respond with an all-encompassing fob-off excuse - in this case &quot;hygiene&quot; - just ask your council why something is so &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .  The other response I was expecting was &quot;health and safety&quot;, both of which are questionable in the case of being barefoot in a gym.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My full query wasn&#39;t answered either, so I responded:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subject: Re: General Enquiry - from davidlloyd.co.uk&lt;br /&gt;\nDate: Mon, 13 Dec 2010 14:23:32 +0000&lt;br /&gt;\nFrom: Colin Seymour&lt;br /&gt;\nTo: Matthew Bridle&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hi Matthew&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your response.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn&#39;t actually questioning running barefoot in the gym, but merely utilising the gym barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your response, though I&#39;m disappointed the response is the very predictable &quot;for hygiene reasons&quot;. It had to be this or the equally predicable &quot;for health and safety reasons&quot;, both of which are questionable and neither consistently enforced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I understand the need for an attempt at consistency though; thanks for answering this part of my query anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My question regarding moving between the front door/change rooms and the warmup/cooldown/stretching area hasn&#39;t been answered.  Must I wear shoes for this short transition and in this area?  I&#39;m particularly concerned&lt;br /&gt;\nabout IN this area as this area is where people train core strength and balance, both of which benefit significantly from being barefoot.  I note this area doesn&#39;t enforce a &quot;clean shoes&quot; policy (like the shower/pool area) so who knows what kind of stuff is being trampled in on people&#39;s trainers and then transferred to their clothes, hands and then onto the gym equipment to be picked up by others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If so, would your front desk staff be happy to look after my shoes whilst I go out for a run each time?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&lt;br /&gt;\nColin&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;PS The online version of the Members&#39; Handbook and the printed copy&lt;br /&gt;\ndon&#39;t match with the online version including a few typos too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I just wanted some clarification on this final point as this is when I&#39;m most likely to be barefoot in the gym and the most appropriate place to be barefoot.  I knew what the response would be, but I had to ask just in case I was wrong, after all this is a company that apparently prides itself in it&#39;s highly trained and educated instructors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The response...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From: Matthew Bridle&lt;br /&gt;\nTo: Colin Seymour&lt;br /&gt;\nSent: Monday, 13 December, 2010 3:33:35 PM GMT +00:00 GMT Britain, Ireland, Portugal&lt;br /&gt;\nSubject: RE: General Enquiry - from davidlloyd.co.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hi Colin,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your response. It is regrettable that you feel the response is predictable. Unfortunately these are the reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You would need to wear footwear to warm up /down. The reception team would happily hold on to your footwear for you whilst you run outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Regards&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Matthew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... but nice to know his receptionists are happy to hold onto my Vibrams whilst I go out for a run.  I wonder if this will change when my Vibrams start getting their own &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/vibram-stink&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;personality&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So as you can see, I&#39;ve been given the classic fob-off response, which really doesn&#39;t surprise me. Given people&#39;s ignorance about the benefits of barefoot, I had to ask. The whole talk of being interested in their member&#39;s views etc is bollocks. They&#39;re here to make money and expect everyone to just shut up and abide by the rules, even if they are very vague, inconsistently applied and not even explicitly documented.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So to summarise...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can you go barefoot in David Lloyd gyms?&lt;/em&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt; you can not go barefoot in David Lloyd gyms, though this will of course be contradicted by the gym themselves when it comes to things like pilates and yoga, because &quot;hygiene&quot; is selective &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why can&#39;t I go barefoot, even in the warmup/cooldown/stretching area?&lt;/em&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, from what I can pick up from the responses of the two managers - they don&#39;t think it looks nice (hence it&#39;s part of the &quot;dress code&quot; rule). Neither do huge fat obese arses in lycra or ancient knobbly knees in shorts, but they&#39;re certainly not going to enforce a dress code here.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I guess in order for this statement on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/home/memberslounge/faqs/complaint-escalation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Complaint Escalation&lt;/a&gt; page (you need to log in to the members&#39; lounge to view this)...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;David Lloyd FeedBack&quot; src=&quot;/assets/DLFeedBack.jpg&quot; width=&quot;490&quot; height=&quot;75&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... to have any sort of meaning I&#39;d have to raise a formal complaint and escalation.  I certainly don&#39;t think this is worth being that petty about, but I think I will have a hunt around for the suggestion box so I can make a suggestion about their dress code policy. Come to think of it, if you&#39;re a member of a David Lloyd and wish to spend more time barefoot whilst working out, please let me know and I may just put up a suggestion request we can all use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re a member of the David Lloyd team reading this, why not raise the suggestion in your next team meeting. Barefoot is good for you.  It makes you stronger and fitter and healthier and the air-time you feet get actually reduces the numbers of bad bacteria and fungus on your feet. The benefits out-weigh the risks. Whilst you&#39;re at it why not ask for a team barefoot training session with Lee Saxby so you can all enhance your skills and understanding of going barefoot or join me for one of my barefoot runs - you will be expected to be barefoot too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and I think I may be on a VIP list (or is it a hit list?) at the gym now as ever since this email correspondence all the instructors who previously didn&#39;t say a word to me and barely acknowledged my existence are all suddenly saying hello, asking how my run was and even popping up out of nowhere where ever I am only to very quickly disappear - me thinks they&#39;re checking up on me. Maybe I&#39;m being paranoid and they&#39;re only being polite now they know I&#39;m around quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">First Cold Winter Barefoot Run</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-cold-winter-run\"/>\n   <updated>2010-12-08T16:04:40+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-cold-winter-run</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Today I ventured out for my very first &quot;very cold barefoot run&quot;.  It&#39;s been a bit late coming as last week saw large parts of the UK covered in snow, and if your area wasn&#39;t covered in snow, it was freeeeeeeezing.  My area was a bit of both - we had a light dusting of snow on two days and then sub-zero temperatures for the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been doing a fair bit of reading on cold weather barefoot running and I&#39;ve drawn a line in the sand (or should that be snow) as to when I will and will not head out for a run barefoot.  That line is 0°C.  This is technically freezing point or water at sea-level and if the air is this cold, there&#39;s a very good chance the ground and water on it will be too - probably colder once you add the salt and grit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On Monday I went out in Vibrams as I had scheduled a fast tempo run along the Thames which would take in quite a long section of pavement that was quite heavily gritted.  It was also bordering 0°C so I didn&#39;t want to risk it.  Today it was definitely warmer, so I decided I&#39;d brave the cold and I&#39;m glad I did.  It wasn&#39;t anywhere near as bad as I thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/?p=7180&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Owen McCall&#39;s very good tips&lt;/a&gt;, I&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;over dressed&lt;/strong&gt;: tights, long sleeve t-shirt, close fitting windbreaker, beanie and gloves&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;warmed up inside&lt;/strong&gt;: dynamic warm ups from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0451222326?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0451222326&quot;&gt;Brain Training for Runners&lt;/a&gt; with some kettlebell swings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... and then headed out a little on the sweaty side.  Normally I&#39;d strip off at this point but I held back and stayed wrapped up for my entire run.  My body and feet soon cooled down a bit in the 1 mile to the field in which I did my 6x600m intervals at 3k pace.  The cool down wasn&#39;t dramatic and I soon found my feet warmed up again too.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The coldest part of the run was running on grassy sections no one else had passed over that day.  The grass was still a little dewy and cold, but thankfully not frozen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bar the very strange looks I got from people I passed, my first very cold barefoot run turned out to be a great success and provided the temperature is above 0°C on a given day and I&#39;m not running through heavily gritted areas, I&#39;ll continue to do my runs barefoot this winter.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Barefoot Ken Bob’s Running Barefoot Book</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-ken-bob-s-running-barefoot-book\"/>\n   <updated>2010-12-01T15:15:14+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-ken-bob-s-running-barefoot-book</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Time to fire up your browsers and head over to Amazon (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Book-Barefoot-Running-Scientifically/dp/1592334652/barefootrunner-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Book-Barefoot-Running-Scientifically/dp/1592334652/barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;) and get pre-ordering.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ken Bob Saxton&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; running barefoot book...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Complete Book of Barefoot Running: Learn the Scientifically Proven Technique for Improving Your Stride and Reducing Injuries&quot; src=&quot;/assets/BarefootRunning-KenBob.jpg&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Available for pre-order on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Book-Barefoot-Running-Scientifically/dp/1592334652/barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Book-Barefoot-Running-Scientifically/dp/1592334652/barefootrunner-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Complete Book of Barefoot Running: Learn the Scientifically Proven Technique for Improving Your Stride and Reducing Injuries&lt;/em&gt; (a bit of a mouthful) is now available for pre-order and &lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/?p=7214&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it looks like it&#39;ll be out&lt;/a&gt; in time for next year&#39;s Boston Marathon (18 April 2011).

After all, Ken Bob is probably the most experienced barefoot runner out there and experience counts for a lot.  His &lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; is a continual source of information for many runners, including me, so I&#39;ve got high hopes of this book becoming my font of knowledge when I can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to access the internet to look something up.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Coolboard is Cool for Core</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/coolboard-is-cool-for-core\"/>\n   <updated>2010-11-24T12:51:07+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/coolboard-is-cool-for-core</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;For quite some time now, a colleague at work has had this overly large skateboard propped up against his desk.  I&#39;ve never questioned it and never seen him actually using it and always thought it was some gimmicky toy somehow related to TopGear as it has &quot;CoolBoard&quot; written on it - I&#39;m a techie by trade so it&#39;s not uncommon to encounter strange toys and gadgets in the office.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the other day we were discussing our ailments and the core strengthening exercises prescribed by my physio to help with my hip and that&#39;s when he explained his fancy skateboard to me.  It&#39;s not a skateboard.  It&#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coolboard.co.uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CoolBoard&lt;/a&gt; - essentially a skateboard shaped plank of wood which you then stand on whilst balancing on a 5-inch ball - which, to quote the website, is &quot;&lt;em&gt;the most effective and engaging trainer for balance, core strength and stability, stabilising muscles and proprioception&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;CoolBoard&quot; src=&quot;/assets/CoolBoard.png&quot; width=&quot;522&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the brief explanation given to me, I just had to give it a go.  It looks simple enough, but I soon found out it was anything but simple.  The first challenge is getting upright and balanced and then maintaining that balanced position. I&#39;ve used it for about 30 mins a day on 3 of the past 5 days (I didn&#39;t use it on the weekend) and I think I&#39;m starting to get the hang of it. Getting up, balanced and maintaining the balance is now possible, though I can&#39;t do it for much longer than about 30 to 60 seconds at a time.  I can certainly confirm it does a brilliant job of working your core muscles and the stabilising muscles in your legs and I&#39;m very impressed.  This simple little device provides quite a workout and it&#39;s way better than any other core stability device I&#39;ve used before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The goal now is to get up to a balanced position without any support and then hold the position for several minutes at a time.  When this becomes easy, I&#39;ll start complicating things by trying to squat or do other activities on the board.  Thankfully my colleague keeps this in the office, so I don&#39;t need to get one for myself (they&#39;re very expensive), though I wouldn&#39;t say no if Santa snuck one into my Christmas stocking this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully some regular balancing, along with my prescribed exercises, will have the desired effect and increase my core strength and completely and permanently relieve me of the discomfort I sometime feel in my right hip.  Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Terra Plana Neos Coming Soon</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/terra-plana-neos-coming-soon\"/>\n   <updated>2010-11-10T08:44:07+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/terra-plana-neos-coming-soon</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Just got wind of a new pair of running shoes coming to Terra Plana&#39;s Vivobarefoot range next month...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Terra Plana Neo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/TerraPlanaNeo.jpg&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;Terra Plana Neo - Coming December 2010&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I like.

Since then, there has been a marked increase in their numbers and it&#39;s not uncommon to spot them circling over parts of west Berkshire, especially along the M4 corridor (hmmmmm, plenty of roadkill).  In fact, they&#39;re so common now, I find it odd not to see one on a clear day circling over the neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;I think it&#39;s pretty amazing to have birds of prey circling over my house and neighbourhood so I always take a moment to watch them for a while, especially when out running.  It adds a bit of interest to the run.  Anyway, yesterday when I went for my run, I spotted a red kite in the air as I made my way through Maiden Erleigh and watched is circle and glide and generally survey the &#39;hood.  I then watched it grow a pair of metaphorical balls and come right down and check me out.  The kite came literally within 2 meters of the top of my head and circled at that height two or three times before retreating back to the loftier heights. It was pretty amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I&#39;ve seen a kite come this close to a human.  They don&#39;t even come this close when I&#39;m standing on the balcony of our second floor flat, so this was definitely a bold one.

I&#39;m probably a hot topic of discussion in the red kite circles of west Berkshire and he probably just had to get a good look to find out if it was true: &lt;em&gt;does that man in the blue and black jacket &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; run without any shoes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the topic of red kites, the latter part of my run took me through an area of Woodley predominantly inhabited by the older generation, and I noticed a flock about about 10 to 15 of them circling and swooping down over one of the roads a few rows back from where I was running: I think maybe one of the old dears may have croaked it and fallen off her mobility scooter.

A brief explanation can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;http://peakperformance.runnersworld.com/2010/10/oct-21-a-new-science-is-born-computational-marathoning.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this Runner&#39;s World article&lt;/a&gt;.  Now the calculations involved are pretty complex, but thankfully you don&#39;t need to be a mathematician to take advantage of them.  Simply plug in your details into his easy to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://endurancecalculator.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt; (requires Java) and then get eating and running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With a bit of carbo-loading at my current age and fitness level (though I think this has been a bit over-simplified as it only relies on my current resting heart rate), apparently I should be able to do a sub-3 hour marathon without hitting the wall:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;EnduranceCalculatorResults.png&quot; src=&quot;/assets/EnduranceCalculatorResults.png&quot; width=&quot;508&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now whilst this is all well and good, it does concentrate on the use of carbohydrates as the primary fuel source, which is understandable.  I wonder how the results of this study would be affected by someone who&#39;s trained their body to primarily burn fat for fuel, like those on ketogenic diets or even someone on Atkins.  Whilst I know these aren&#39;t &quot;ideal&quot; competition diets by current convention, I have heard of ultra-marathon runners &quot;fat-loading&quot; to fuel them for their runs with great success.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Minimalist Running Shoes: Is Less More?</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/minimalist-running-shoes-is-less-more\"/>\n   <updated>2010-10-20T10:31:48+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/minimalist-running-shoes-is-less-more</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Quite a long and quite interesting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-240-400--13691-1-1X2X3X4X5X6X7X8-9,00.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; on the growing use of minimalist running shoes from Runner&#39;s World.

There&#39;s a slight nip in the air, the leaves are starting to fall and the squirrels are out in full force gathering nuts and seeds for the winter ahead. This is quite a stark contrast to what I&#39;ve just been enjoying for the last two weeks: hot sunny Spanish weather with no running, lots of swimming, food and beer, and not much else.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just got back from my first run in just over two weeks following my belated summer holiday and what a wonderful run it was.  I felt full of bounce and seemed to just glide my way along. The cool nip in the air punctuated by dappled sunshine was very refreshing, and the feeling of the cool tar under my feet broken up by intermittent patches of freshly dropped leaves quite exhilarating.  Of course, I don&#39;t think the squirrels were too happy with me suddenly appearing behind or right next to them completely unannounced: there was a lot of squirrel screeching and scurrying and not too many happy squirrels, but hey-ho, that&#39;s what happens when a nutter like me works near a nice wooded area.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m looking forward to running barefoot this autumn.  Autumn is one of my favourite times to run and this year will be my first year completely barefoot.  I&#39;m also eager to see how far into winter I can go before I feel the need to wear shoes because of the cold.  If we don&#39;t get the snow we had last year, I may be able to make it all the way through. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">The Evolution of NB Minimus</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/evolution-of-nb-minimus\"/>\n   <updated>2010-10-06T15:36:01+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/evolution-of-nb-minimus</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;New Balance Minimus trail shoe&quot; src=&quot;/assets/NewBalanceMinimus.jpg&quot; width=&quot;405&quot; height=&quot;210&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;New Balance recently released an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newbalance.com/performance/tony-krupicka-and-chris-wawrousek-talk-about-the-evolution-of-nb-minimus/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; between ultramarathon runner &lt;a href=&quot;http://antonkrupicka.blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tony Krupicka&lt;/a&gt;, a New Balance shoe designer Chris Wawrousek and someone acting on behalf of NewBalance.com that goes over the iterative design process behind the NB Minimus Trail shoe due out in 2011.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty interesting stuff, and I quite like the little slide show towards the end showing each of the iterative steps in the design process.

I&#39;ve just been incredibly busy at work and when not at work, I&#39;ve been frantically coding a new PHP based API wrapper - &lt;a href=&quot;http://phpzenfolio.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;phpZenfolio&lt;/a&gt; - for the guys at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zenfolio.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zenfolio&lt;/a&gt;. All this busy-ness saps inspiration, but I&#39;m feeling a bit inspired to write an update, so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Running&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First, the important part: the running.  What&#39;s happening with the running?  Well, I&#39;m still doing it and am now back on track and running as I was before my injury.  I&#39;m diligently sticking to a 5k training programme from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Brain-Training-Runners-Revolutionary-Endurance/dp/0451222326/barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brain Training for Runners&lt;/a&gt; to ensure I don&#39;t push things to soon, but also to actually give me a proper progressive and measurable training programme.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve gone for the 5k programme for a couple of reasons: &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&#39;s a moderate volume programme so I&#39;m not likely to be doing too much too soon.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All the training runs are well within the limits of being able to do them completely barefoot.  The 10k programme starts to push things to the point where I would likely be running on sensitive feet quite often which would severely affect my ability to actually train at the required intensity, but also affect the build up of the skin and flesh under my feet.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I&#39;ve always been better at the shorter distances than the long and I think concentrating on 5k for a while will do me the world of good in the long run.  The increased emphasis on speed will definitely help with the 10ks later.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also still running barefoot, though I am starting to &quot;warm up&quot; my Evos and huaraches in preparation for winter.  I plan to run for as long as possible barefoot, but just in case we get another severe winter like last year, I want to be sure I don&#39;t get any blisters when I switch to using one of these for any extended period of time later when my mileage is higher.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;My Back&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things are going well with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/finally-sorting-my-back-out&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;back&lt;/a&gt; or more precisely my right SI joint and lower back. I now have a diagnosis: a hypo-mobile right sacroiliac joint most likely caused by the use of my abs and hamstrings when I should be using my glutes and pelvic muscles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been given some SI joint stretches to do 3 times a day along with a progressively longer list of pelvic exercises designed to strengthen my pelvic muscles and teach my body to engage my pelvic muscles rather than handing control to my abs or hamstrings.  These are surprisingly simple exercises, but they take a bit of concentration to do right and it takes a while to get into the swing of things.  Things like pelvic tilts and pelvic bridges.  Simple exercises, but in someone &quot;hamstring-centric&quot; like me, it&#39;s tough forcing myself to disengage my hamstrings and let my other muscles do the work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One thing is for certain, the pain is significantly reduced and I think I&#39;m starting to notice the benefit of these exercises in my running.  The physio did mention this would be a consequence and would actually benefit my running.  With this bit of news, I have some renewed enthusiasm to keep performing the exercises and make sure I&#39;m doing them right.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a &quot;toe bone is connected to the finger bone&quot; sort of way, my hip problem is likely to have contributed to whatever caused my foot injury, if not being the primary cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Racing&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve decided to put all racing on the back-burner for the moment to concentrate on training and sorting out my hip/lower back problem.  This includes the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reading Parkruns&lt;/a&gt;.  Whilst these aren&#39;t formal races, they do have a race feel to them and I can&#39;t help but push and race them, especially now I&#39;ve cracked 20 mins more often than not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on the weather and how my training goes, I may pick up running the Parkruns in November, maybe December.  I&#39;ll certainly be picking them up again before summer next year &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all, things are going well with me.  I&#39;ve got a few weeks holiday coming up, so running will take a bit of a backseat but I&#39;ll be back refreshed and rearing to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Comments Working Again</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/comments-working-again\"/>\n   <updated>2010-09-27T16:34:55+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/comments-working-again</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Oooops, I updated the underlying code of this site a while ago and completely forgot that the comment form functionality changed.

Yes? Ah, but do you really? If you&#39;re thinking I&#39;m referring to golfers, think again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to the new breed of British runners, yes runners, who now have a handicap. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runbritain.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;runbritain&lt;/a&gt; has just introduced a new handicap scoring system that is designed to give road runners of all abilities the ability to benchmark their progress and compare their results across a range of distances and terrains.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To quote the runbritain Rankings site:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scoring system, which has been developed in conjunction with the team behind the McCain Power of 10 website, rewards regular racing and factors in a degree of difficulty for slower courses. The score is derived from your results at 5K, 10K, Half Marathon &amp; Marathon during 2010 and thereafter on a rolling 12 month basis although you only need to have done one race in 2010 to claim a handicap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runbritainrankings.com/user/claimhandicap.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;registered&lt;/a&gt;, you just need to enter at least one race you&#39;ve run this year and then be amazed at your handicap which will be in the range of -2 for the elites and 36 in 0.1 increments.  Keep adding race results and watch your handicap adjust.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Everytime you login, you&#39;ll be taken to your personal biography page which displays:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;current rankings at each distance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;personal progress graph&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;direct comparisons with other runners with a &#39;head-to-head&#39; function&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;handicap score updated automatically after each run&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; target times to bring score down to the next level&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;training schedules to help you achieve your targets&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So if you haven&#39;t done so already, head on over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runbritainrankings.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;runbritain Rankings&lt;/a&gt; and claim your handicap.  Oh and don&#39;t forget to bring up your handicap when chatting over that ice cold beer after your next race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the curious, my handicap after three 5k Parkruns and two 10k races is...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;My runbritain Rankings Handicap&quot; src=&quot;/assets/handicap.png&quot; width=&quot;163&quot; height=&quot;119&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... with all races done completely barefoot.

I can&#39;t pin-point any one action that causes the discomfort or anything that aggravates it, but it seems to crop up every 3 to 4 months and then hangs about for a month or two.  Then all is well until it&#39;s next occurrence several months later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have managed to work out that if I am feeling the discomfort, it&#39;s easier for me to take things one step further into the world of excruciating pain if I sit a bit wonky on the sofa and get up without correcting my posture first.  Thankfully I can catch this just as it starts to pinch and avoid the pain, though I have caught myself 3 times &quot;pinching&quot; something without any warning. This has left me almost immobile for a week at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As this seems to be a recurrent thing that isn&#39;t going away, I&#39;m off to the physio today to get a full assessment. Hopefully that will shed some light on the cause and provide a means to resolve it.  I suspect it may be due to my slightly wonky spine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the running side of things, the last two weeks have been good.  No problems with my running at all and I&#39;m feeling great.  I&#39;m deliberately taking things quite slowly so I don&#39;t introduce any problems and have decided to follow a more structured training programme.  Hopefully the gradual increase in volume and pace will keep things on course for a cracking race in about 16 weeks time.  Until then I&#39;ll be keeping the racing to a bare minimum.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Wooohooo!!!

I&#39;m running again folks and boy does it feel good to be back out there running. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been just over 6 weeks since I &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/tofp-probably-stress-fracture&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hurt my foot&lt;/a&gt; and I decided yesterday was the day to finally head out and test how my foot has recovered.  I can say it was a great success.  I took a gentle 1 mile out-and-back run and all felt good.  I could feel a slight niggle on the top of my left foot during the early stages but this soon disappeared as my muscles relaxed and I adjusted my form.  As I was feeling so good, I threw in 4 sets of 10 &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burpee_(exercise)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;burpees&lt;/a&gt; with each set immediately followed by a fast 50m run.  Wow these felt good.  It was tough towards the end but quite exciting to feel what it feels like to run on legs that feel like jelly again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, my legs and feet all feel tip-top this morning, so 6 weeks off hasn&#39;t de-conditioned me much.  That said, my feet are a bit more sensitive now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The time not running wasn&#39;t all lost time.  During this time I have discovered quite a bit about my stride, feet and legs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Top of the Foot Pain Relief&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is quite an obscure one, but I found that using a pair of lovely pink &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000P5W0GM?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=barefootrunner-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B000P5W0GM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;toe separators&lt;/a&gt; - yes the type ladies use for painting their toe nails - actually relieved some of the pain I was feeling on the top of my foot.  I have no idea why, but it works and whilst it got uncomfortable after prolonged use, it was a brilliant way of relieving the pain at it&#39;s peak.  I&#39;m going to continue to use the toe separators each night whilst watching telly to see if it has any effect on spreading my toes and thus giving a wider more stable platform to run on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;It Twists&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The niggle on the top of my foot showed me that my left foot twists ever-so-slightly when pushing off when walking. I could feel it with each stride. My heel twists inwards as I roll over the ball of my foot.  As I couldn&#39;t run when I discovered this, I can&#39;t say if I have this same &quot;feature&quot; when running, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if I do, especially as concentrating on NOT twisting and NOT pushing off whilst running seemed to ease the twinge I felt at the early stages of yesterday&#39;s run. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Knee Bone Connected to Toe Bone&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I also got my hands on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002JJQSOW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=costest-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B002JJQSOW&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;15cm x 90cm foam roller&lt;/a&gt; and was very surprised to find I had quite a few tight spots in my hamstrings and calves.  My legs generally feel good and well relaxed so I was quite surprised to find these deep hidden knots.  What is interesting is relaxing some of the knots in my calves, particularly my left calf, also relieved some of the pain in my foot; I could actually feel the tension easing away from the tendons on the top of my foot whilst pressing on one of the knots. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So whilst having an injury isn&#39;t the best thing in the world, it&#39;s turned out to be quite beneficial for me.  I now know that my left foot probably has a tendency to twist as I run and hence the possible cause of the injury.  I now know that toe separators aren&#39;t just for girls and I&#39;m also aware that I have unknowingly tight muscles, or more specifically tight areas of muscle fascia which will benefit from regular and consistent deep tissue massage or &quot;foam rollering&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Terra Plana are Hosting Barefoot Experience Workshops</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/terra-plana-are-hosting-barefoot-experience-workshops\"/>\n   <updated>2010-08-12T17:29:53+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/terra-plana-are-hosting-barefoot-experience-workshops</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I know this is a bit short notice, but I&#39;ve been a tad on the excessively busy side of things are work and really haven&#39;t wanted to touch a computer when I got home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in taking the plunge into barefoot running, but want to be sure you&#39;re doing it right or with a bit of guidance, why not take advantage of the Barefoot Experience Workshops Terra Plana are hosting next week...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;Learn the skill of barefoot walking and running at &#39;The Barefoot Experience&#39; Terra Plana, 36 Kings Road, London SW3.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Spearheaded by new research and the international bestseller &#39;Born to Run&#39; the barefoot movement is gathering pace.

Being one eager to see how others can learn about barefoot running, I graciously accepted Jason&#39;s offer and a couple of weeks later a copy of his booked dropped through the letterbox.  Thanks Jason.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing that struck me was the size of the book, or more precisely the lack there of.  The book is A5 in dimensions and has only 52 pages of reading material, excluding the exercises and appendix at the back, however the lack of size is easily made up by the wealth of information contained within.  The book is broken up into 5 progressive sections: &lt;em&gt;Why Barefoot Running, Pre-running, Starting to Run Barefoot, Intermediate Barefoot Running&lt;/em&gt; and finally &lt;em&gt;Other Topics&lt;/em&gt; which covers things like hecklers, training and cross training. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Each section is broken into individual points explaining a concept, activity or issue, and provides a clear description of each as it guides you from the very beginning up to the point of being a relatively seasoned barefoot runner. As the whole book is written as a series of progressive points, it does make it feel a bit &quot;jumpy&quot; when reading it cover-to-cover.  I got the feeling that it may have come from a collection of blog posts compiled into a single book.  However this structure does make it an easy reference to turn to if you need to check up on something quickly so it&#39;s perfectly suited to the beginner who would otherwise spend the time trawling the web for answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the structure and layout of the book out of the way, I can say Jason does a good job of introducing the complete beginner to the world of barefoot running.  He starts off by correctly pointing out that barefoot and minimalist running may not be for everyone, whether that be due to medical or preferential reasons, but does mention that it&#39;s definitely worth considering, even if just as a supplement to your normal shod running.  He also references several studies on the effects of modern running shoes, but doesn&#39;t go to the point of bashing the manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jason then takes the reader through a deliberately slow and relaxed approach to getting ready for barefoot running, relaxing (this is very important and Jason puts a lot of emphasis on this), strengthening the feet and skin, and then finally heading out for a run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just before the reader actually heads out for their first run, the topics of cadence, form and posture are covered and then once out running things are progressed nicely to cover efficiency, different terrains, weather and increasing speed and distance.  The book then finishes off covering developing your training further and incorporating cross training for development of the rest of your body.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I do have a few criticisms with the book.  First is its price: I didn&#39;t have to pay for my copy, but others may be a bit disappointed by the size of the book compared to it&#39;s price, however the book is self published so the costs will be higher. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; alt=&quot;The Barefoot Running Book - Second Edition Cover&quot; src=&quot;/assets/BarefootBook-JB2ndEd.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;311&quot; /&gt;Next is Jason&#39;s suggestion that people find the form that feels right for them.  My own experience is showing that this is not the best approach.  Form is important and whilst the comfortable form it easy to fall into and get used to, it may not be the best and without correction injury may ensue. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, and this isn&#39;t really a criticism, but a niggle: the cover it terrible.  I wouldn&#39;t pick this book up when passing it on a shelf in the book shop.  Thankfully for Jason, he&#39;s been told this already, or worked it out for himself as the next edition is coming with a much more attractive cover (see right).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In summary, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Barefoot-Running-Book-Practical-Minimalist/dp/0615354440/barefootrunner-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Barefoot Running Book&lt;/a&gt; is a good, easily referenced, introduction to barefoot running for anybody interested in taking up barefoot running, or just incorporating a bit of barefoot running into their training schedule.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And for those on the bleeding edge of technology, it&#39;s available for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kindle-Wireless-Reader-3G-Wifi-Graphite/dp/B002LVUWFE/barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt; in both the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Barefoot-Running-Book-Minimalist-ebook/dp/B003PJ7BX2/barefootrunner-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; AND even the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Barefoot-Running-Book-Practical-Minimalist/dp/B003PJ7BX2/barefootrunner-21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">How to Start Running In Minimalist Shoes</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/how-to-start-running-minimalist-shoes\"/>\n   <updated>2010-07-27T16:42:56+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/how-to-start-running-minimalist-shoes</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I received the following query in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-the-forest-five-2010#comment-496&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;br /&gt;\nI&#39;m a Physio based in Guildford. I&#39;ve been looking into barefoot running for the last 6 months having had repetitive shin splints from running in expensive shoes-and finally found some fivefingers on sale. So I&#39;ve taken the plunge and ordered some kso&#39;s to test the whole barefoot running out of both personal and professional interest. Can I ask, how did you start out? What sort of training plan would you advise?&lt;br /&gt;\nThanks,&lt;br /&gt;\nJoe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started to write a response to the comment in the comments section of that post and realised it was becoming a rather long response and should probably warrant it&#39;s own post so others can find it too.  So here it is and sorry about the delay in writing it Joe, it&#39;s been a crazy few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;It&#39;s been just over a year since &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/no-more-shoes&quot;&gt;I declared I wouldn&#39;t run in normal running shoes&lt;/a&gt; ever again. Since then I&#39;ve transitioned to running completely barefoot and built up a fair bit of knowledge and experience and with hindsight on my side, I wouldn&#39;t recommend the route I took.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I came into barefoot running by going the minimalist route first, specifically in Vibram Five Fingers, and whilst I took things slowly (&lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals-on-hold-for-the-moment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;only after taking things too fast and feeling a bit tender at times&lt;/a&gt;), I still think I didn&#39;t spend enough time on working on my form in the early days when running in the Vibrams.  As a result I&#39;ve built up a good base for barefoot running, but I think I&#39;ve still got some sort of form issues and hence the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/tofp-probably-stress-fracture&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;injury&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;m currently sitting with.  If I were to do things all over again, I would start completely barefoot, perfect my form and then transition to the Vibrams or other minimalist shoes and I recommend anyone else considering making the transition do the same thing.  (Actually, I wouldn&#39;t go to the VFF now &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The idea of transitioning to minimalist shoes by going completely barefoot may sound counter-intuitive, but it&#39;s not really. Starting out barefoot, rather than in Vibrams or other minimalist shoes, will ensure you have the perfect &quot;coach&quot; by your side, or more precisely under you.  Your bare feet will start off very weak, very soft and very sensitive.  This weakness and sensitivity will act as the perfect guide to ensuring you don&#39;t over do things and they&#39;ll allow you to very quickly and easily assess if you&#39;re going too far or too fast and if you have any form issues that need ironing out.   By starting in the minimalist shoes, you&#39;ll have a thin layer of rubber between your soft sensitive feet and the ground.  Whilst not significant, it&#39;s enough to dull some of the sensations your feet could be experiencing and thus reduce the feedback you get.  This in turn will encourage you to go too far, too fast, too soon without ensuring good form and you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; get hurt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now with that out of the way, I highly recommend you read through and action &lt;strong&gt;ALL&lt;/strong&gt; of Ken Bob Saxton&#39;s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/?page_id=525&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How to Run&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and build yourself a good barefoot base before slipping on the Vibrams.  Ken Bob is probably the most experienced barefoot runner in the western world and he&#39;s done a tremendous job of documenting the process of learning to run barefoot correctly.  Any attempts I make would pale in comparison and I&#39;m not confident I have enough experience just yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Only when you&#39;re easily and comfortably running 3 - 5 km completely barefoot do I think you should consider transitioning to the Vibrams or other minimalist shoes, if of course you still want to go this route &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .  This should give you a good base and should ensure your feet and lower legs are trained well for the task with your form as close to perfect as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This may not play well into any racing plans or other short-term dreams you may have, but putting them on hold and starting from rock bottom and building up is &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; the best thing to do to ensure a long and rewarding, and hopefully injury free, minimalist or barefoot running career.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Phys Ed: Do Certain Types of Sneakers Prevent Injuries?</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/do-certain-types-of-sneakers-prevent-injuries\"/>\n   <updated>2010-07-22T08:01:12+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/do-certain-types-of-sneakers-prevent-injuries</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;In a word: Nope.

Have I done this right?  Did I do that wrong? Could I have done something different?  And that&#39;s when it struck me: yes I could have done something different.  I could have put my ego/desires in my pocket and listened to my body, but I didn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;It was whilst reviewing the training log entry I made for my run on 22 June that the penny dropped...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill piggies barefoot&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I wanted a hill session, but was in the mood for making it a bit of a stinker so I did doggies (pyramids of 200m, 400m, 600m, 800m, 800m, 600m, 400m, 200m fast with equal recovery between each to other people) but as each fast rep it uphill, I called them piggies. Unfortunately I developed a bit of a twinge on the top of left foot on the 2nd fast 800m so stopped after that rep and didn&#39;t do the whole stack. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Felt good and felt as though I could have come back down the other side of the stack, but better safe than sorry. I don&#39;t want to injure myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What I didn&#39;t document was the beginning of this training session.  As I set off out of the office, I felt a little discomfort in my left foot.  At the time it felt like a joint in my foot hadn&#39;t &quot;popped&quot; yet - that feeling you get when you think you need to crack a knuckle or something to release a bit of tension or pressure.  I&#39;ve encountered these in my toes and ankles for years (as a kid, all my joints used to &quot;pop&quot; after a period of inactivity which was a bit embarrassing in a huge dead quiet school hall at a prize giving ceremony) and thought this was another one of those occasions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It took nearly 7km of running for my body to tell me in no uncertain terms that this wasn&#39;t one of those occasions.  All through this run, I kept trying to pop the joints in my foot to relieve the feeling of needing to pop them, but the pops weren&#39;t coming and neither was the sensation dissipating.  The final twinge on the last 800m that I did was my body telling me in no uncertain terms: &lt;strong&gt;STOP!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My foot was then tender for just over week.  Had I listened to my body when I first set out, I probably wouldn&#39;t have had the discomfort during the run, the discomfort during the next week and a bit and the pain that struck at just after the 8km mark in the race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hindsight is a wonderful thing from which I need to learn.  Like a naughty schoolboy, I&#39;ve been told off by my body for not doing as I was told and now I&#39;m paying the price.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So if this post has to have a take away message it&#39;s: &lt;strong&gt;listen to your body&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is continually preached in the barefoot running circles, and I&#39;ve preached it myself, but now I need to actually take heed and start to really listen.  I need to, and will, err on the side of caution from here on in.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">How Do You Ride Your Bike Then?</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/how-do-you-ride-your-bike-then\"/>\n   <updated>2010-07-17T12:36:58+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/how-do-you-ride-your-bike-then</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I worked from home yesterday and decided I&#39;d go for a gentle walk up to the local park and back to get a bit of exercise and to keep my feet used to being barefoot.

I replied: &quot;&lt;em&gt;Because I don&#39;t want to hurt my feet&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.

After a bit of searching three, possibilities came up:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/cybertherapist/front/foot/extensor_tendons.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;extensor tendonitis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/cybertherapist/front/foot/metatarsal.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;metatarsal stress fracture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/cybertherapist/front/foot/mortons.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Morton&#39;s neuroma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Given the size and tenderness of the top of my foot (too big and tender to easily diagnose the above), I decided not to go to the doctor.  I didn&#39;t want to try driving and wasn&#39;t too confident they&#39;d be able to diagnose much from my fat foot without an X-ray, and even then there&#39;s a good chance they wouldn&#39;t be able to see a problem.  If it was one of the first two, there&#39;s also very little that could be done anyway.  I&#39;m also a firm believer in if it&#39;s something you can heal yourself without any problems or too much discomfort, then don&#39;t waste the NHS&#39;s time and money - there are much sicker and more broken people than me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Instead I spent the next few days resting and icing my foot at regular intervals.  This did a good job of reducing the pain and swelling to the point where I could try a bit more self-diagnosis.  Based on the information at the above links and other places on the internet, I ruled out Morton&#39;s neuroma very quickly - the pain is too high up on the top of my foot.  With a bit more poking and prodding and toe wiggling, I think I&#39;ve narrowed it down to a stress fracture of the 3rd metatarsal: I can easily pin-point the exact spot on the top of my foot where it hurts and it&#39;s consistent with the symptoms of a stress fracture.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now to try and work out how I got the stress fracture in the first place.  I have a few theories, and these are really just that: theories and a few accompanying thoughts about each:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sloppy form on my left side:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months I have noticed that my left ankle has felt a bit stiff and tender after the longer runs.  I didn&#39;t feel this on my right ankle, so one possible theory is I&#39;m not relaxing my left ankle enough just before impact and thus not allowing the impact to be absorbed properly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There could also be a twisting action or incorrect landing as I found during the race the twisting my foot inwards slightly seems to reduce the pain on the top of my foot.  That said, that could have just been a coping mechanism and not really indicative of an odd landing, especially as I haven&#39;t had a blister on my left foot in a long long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad form whilst racing in Vibrams earlier in the month:&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the middle of June I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-the-forest-five-2010&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Forest Five&lt;/a&gt; and as it was off road on terrain too rough to go barefoot, I ran in my Vibrams.  It&#39;s certainly quite possible that under race conditions, with less sensory feedback, that I could have slammed my feet down a bit harder than usual and set things in motion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m doubtful this is the primary cause as I didn&#39;t actually experience any discomfort during or after this race, but I suppose just enough damage could have been done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General over use and my left foot just happened to be the weakest link:&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the months and weeks building up to the second race I&#39;d increased my mileage quite a bit and also threw in quite a few races. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m doubtful the mileage is the cause as I&#39;ve been quite good at increasing this slowly, however the racing could be partly responsible as it&#39;s harder to keep good form at pace, especially the 5k&#39;s on grass in which I&#39;ve caught myself several times running with a slightly different form.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So with these thoughts out on paper, so to speak, I&#39;m inclined to believe the cause of the stress fracture is probably the first theory with a little bit of the third, so I&#39;ll be paying special attention to my form on my return to running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a self-certified doctor - Dr Seymour PhD has a nice ring to it &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; - I&#39;ve put myself on a 4 to 6 week break from running to give my foot a chance to heal.  Sadly this means I&#39;ll probably miss the 3rd of the Yateley 10k races, but that&#39;s a small price to pay for longevity in barefoot running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be keeping my fitness levels up with a lot of cycling, rowing and a few weights sessions so hopefully I won&#39;t lose too much fitness. I&#39;ll also be doing as much walking around barefoot as possible to try and ensure my feet don&#39;t soften up too much either. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Who knows, I may come back stronger and fitter than I went out.  Actually, it would be good if I come back a bit lighter too.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Race Report: Yateley 10k Series 2010 - Race 2</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-yateley-10k-series-2010-race-2\"/>\n   <updated>2010-07-09T11:09:26+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-yateley-10k-series-2010-race-2</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Wednesday evening saw the running of the second of the three &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yateley10kseries.info/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yateley 10k races&lt;/a&gt; in the series, and like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/yateley-10k-series-race-1-completed-barefoot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first one&lt;/a&gt;, I ran it barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d had a bit of a sedentary two weeks building up to the race following the onset of the early signs of the dreaded top of foot pain (ToFP) that cropped up during my piggies hill training session on 22 June.  With only a single tabata rowing session done between then and the race I went in the race very relaxed and rested with my foot feeling good too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;At 7:30pm we were sent on our way and I paid special attention to my pace.  I went into this race wanting to crack 45 minutes and intended on doing so by keeping a constant pace that sat in the 4:20 min/km to 4:28 min/km range.  This plan worked beautifully.  I managed to remain disciplined and didn&#39;t get caught up in the excitement of the start of the race too much and managed to keep my pace more or less within this range right up until the 8th km.  This included the particularly stoney tarred section along Reading road between about 5.5km and 7.2km which this time I chose not to try and avoid. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I suspect I could have kept this pace up beyond the 8km mark had it not been for what happened next...  just after the 8km mark the pain on the top of my left foot returned, and with a vengeance.  It was pretty damn painful, but as I&#39;d got most of the way round, there was no way I was going to stop now - I&#39;ll probably regret this later.  I quickly found it wasn&#39;t as painful if I turned my foot inwards slightly and almost rolled over my big toe (could the cause of the pain be due to a slightly outward pointing left foot?) so with my slightly adjusted gait and slower pace I headed for the finish.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Turning into the field entrance I glanced at my watch and noticed I was still on course for a sub-45 10k, so I floored it as best I could, passed a couple of people and crossed the finish line with a new PB: 44:43.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pleased as punch I handed in my timing chip, grabbed a water and a choccy bar and headed back to the car.  The pain in my left foot starting to really sink in now too.  Impressively I had my official results SMS by the time I got back to my car too...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/Yateley 10k 2010 - Race 2.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Yateley 10k Series 2010 Race 2 Results&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Yateley 10k 2010 - Race 2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; title=&quot;705 finishers this time&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all, I had a great run, except for the onset of ToFP at 8km, but that&#39;s incidental really as I&#39;d managed to set a new PB and still had a great time.  Still no sign of any photos from this or the previous race though - I&#39;m starting wonder if they had an official photographer this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&#39;ll have to see what happens with my left foot over the next few weeks.  Hopefully it&#39;ll recover completely in time for the 3rd and final race in the series on 4 August.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Race Report: The Forest Five 2010</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-the-forest-five-2010\"/>\n   <updated>2010-06-23T10:30:51+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/race-report-the-forest-five-2010</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Better late than never.  Last Wednesday saw me take on my first imperial distance race (we only do metric distances in South Africa): &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forestrunners.org.uk/events/forestfive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Forest Five&lt;/a&gt; (mile) at The Look Out in Bracknell and what a fantastic evening and offroad race it was.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/racing-offroad-research-it-first&quot;&gt;the test run I did on the Monday&lt;/a&gt;, I had intended on running in my huaraches, but then common sense prevailed and I opted to run in my Vibrams instead.  I decided not to run in the huaraches as I&#39;ve not done much running in them yet and the last thing I wanted were blisters from the different style of footwear, especially likely as I&#39;m not too sure I&#39;ve got them properly adjusted yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My wife very generously offered to drive me to the race and we arrived with about half an hour to spare.  As I pre-registered online I already had my number so had plenty time to locate the race start - it&#39;s a little walk into the forest - and warm up.  It was a very pleasant evening, so getting warm wasn&#39;t a problem.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;At just after 19:30 we were sent on our way by the most feeble sounding airhorn I&#39;ve ever heard, or didn&#39;t. The air part was there, just the horn part made no sound at all: should have used a vuvuzela &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .  As usual, I set off a little quick, but I managed to ensure it wasn&#39;t too quick and soon settled into a pace of about 4:20/km.  The route was slightly different from the one I found online and ran on the Monday, but only in the last half of the race in which they brought us back in a large arc which included a lot more little ups and downs than the original route.  This added a nice challenge and I suspect caught a few of those who&#39;ve run the old route a little by surprise.  They did however warn us at the beginning that it was a slightly different route, though I couldn&#39;t hear why.  My watch also reported the route to be slightly shorter than 5 miles, but I think we can attribute this to the tree coverage over large parts of the route - the race organisers assured us the route is accurately measured.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As can be expected, my Vibrams lived up to expectations and protected my feet enough for me to maintain a nice fast pace without blocking too much feedback.  They also draw a lot of funny looks and even a couple of comments with one chap commenting on having read Born to Run, but not being brave enough to try barefoot or Vibrams.  I encouraged him to give barefoot a go and he then bid farewell and left me in hist dust &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, this was a very pleasant race.  It was a relatively small field, on a fabulous evening in a beautiful settings.  This is definitely a race I&#39;ll be doing again.  This part of Bracknell forest will also be getting a lot more visits from me too: it&#39;s a fantastic area to run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forestrunners.org.uk/files/bfrfiles/documents/forestv/2010/img-618163026-0001.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official results&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time&lt;/strong&gt;: 34:34&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Overall Position&lt;/strong&gt;: 56 / 327&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Age Category Position&lt;/strong&gt;: 28&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Evoskins From Inov-8</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/evoskins-from-inov-8\"/>\n   <updated>2010-06-19T08:48:05+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/evoskins-from-inov-8</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yfrog.com/jmv0ulj&quot;&gt;Spotted&lt;/a&gt; on t&#39;interweb thingy. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Evoskins.jpg&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Evoskins.jpg&quot; style=&quot;max-width:98%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Surely these can&#39;t be for real.

Tomorrow I will be running the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forestrunners.org.uk/events/forestfive&quot;&gt;Forest Five&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s &quot;&lt;em&gt;5 miles along forest tracks of grass and gravel through the scenic Windsor Forest&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. Sounds good, but can I run it barefoot?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not being one to be beaten by a bit of dirt, I headed out yesterday for a very gentle barefoot run over the course, or at least what I think is the course - with the aid of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0025UHKNS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=costest-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B0025UHKNS&quot;&gt;Garmin Forerunner 405CX&lt;/a&gt; I followed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mapmyrun.com/run/united-kingdom/the-lookout-bracknell-berkshire/533795531&quot;&gt;this route&lt;/a&gt; - to see if I can actually run it barefoot.  If I could, I&#39;d run the race barefoot too, but until I&#39;d covered the whole route, I couldn&#39;t be sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Well, I can say I certainly &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, but I &lt;em&gt;won&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; be racing that route barefoot.  Most of the route is on nice forest floor roads and they&#39;re quite gentle on the feet so I was easily able to keep up a pace of about 5:30/km (nice and slow).  However there is about a 2 km stretch along the back which is definitely not barefoot friendly. There are lots of rocks and pointy stones and very little space to avoid them.  Over this section I saw my pace drop to around 9:30/km as I minced my way along and I honestly can&#39;t see how I&#39;d do that leg any quicker without a bit of protection on my feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So with that bit of research done, I&#39;ve decided I&#39;ll be running the Forest Five tomorrow in my huaraches (I must write about these at some point).  I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve done my little bit of pre-race research as I certainly wouldn&#39;t want to have shown up eager to race barefoot only to find everyone laughing at me as I hobbled along those two tough kilometres. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re planning on a barefoot race, research the route first, especially if part of it will be offroad.  You won&#39;t regret taking the time to do so.  If it&#39;s not possible, err on the side of caution until you are sure your feet can handle the toughest ground nature can throw at you.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Barefoot Reading Parkrun Three</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-reading-parkrun-three\"/>\n   <updated>2010-06-12T13:44:01+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefoot-reading-parkrun-three</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Headed out for my third &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/&quot;&gt;Reading Parkrun&lt;/a&gt; on my own this morning.

Each year, I hear the guys talking about the races so I thought this would be a great re-introduction to road running and my first official race in the UK (at the time I registered I hadn&#39;t planned on doing any of the Parkruns).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;My wife and I made our way over to Yateley and got there for about 18:30 giving me plenty of time to collect my number, timing chip (the race uses Championchips for timing), warm up, queue for the little boys room (I felt like a lady having to queue for the loo) and then make my way into the funnel that is the start of the race.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At 19:31 we were all sent on our way.  Everyone except me were wearing shoes, those crazy fools &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .   The race took us out of the school grounds onto the road.  It was then a moderate climb up to the 3km mark, downhill with a little bump to the 5km mark for our first water station.  Just beyond that we turned onto Reading road for a long lonely flat slog of just short of 2km before turning off, past a sponges station, the 7km mark and another water station and made our way back towards the start/finish with a short little hill just near the 9km mark to keep things interesting and to sap a little bit of that energy you saved for the final sprint home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I thought this was a great route.  Not excessively challenging, but challenging enough to keep it interesting.  From a barefoot perspective, most of the route is very pleasant to run on.  The only places I encountered a bit of difficulty due to excessively large stones in the tar (and a bit of fatigue) was along Reading Road between the 6 and 8km marks and a little section on Firgrove Road just before you go round the roundabout up towards Waitrose.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And now for my results:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/Yateley 10k - Race 1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Yateley 10k - Race 1 Results&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Yateley 10k - Race 1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; title=&quot;There were 694 finishers in total.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, the race uses Championchips for timing.  Thankfully I knew about this before the event so purchased a triathlon timing chip ankle strap to hold my chip. I&#39;m quite impressed with my time, especially the chip time which indicates the time it took me to cover the 10km.  I definitely think a sub-45 is on the cards next time, however I need to add more 10+ km training runs to teach my feet and body to cope with the tough stuff when I&#39;m tired.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all I had a great evening and am now most definitely hooked again.  I&#39;m already starting to look at other races to run other than the 3 Yateley races and have my eye on a few which involve offroad sections, so I&#39;ll have to run these in Vibrams.  Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to post a photo from the race when the official photos become available.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;No Parkrun today.  I&#39;m knackered from a week of insanely early shifts and the race and I know I&#39;d want to race the Parkrun.  Too much racing makes Colin a broken boy. Maybe next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Parkrun Two And a PB Too</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/parkrun-two-and-a-pb-too\"/>\n   <updated>2010-05-29T14:21:39+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/parkrun-two-and-a-pb-too</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;For the second week in a row that crazy nutter was there at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/&quot;&gt;Reading Parkrun&lt;/a&gt; running without any shoes.

I had a great run this morning, but unfortunately, I don&#39;t learn.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/reading-parkrun-barefoot&quot;&gt;Last week&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned I set off a bit fast, well this week I set off faster (3:25 for the first km) and found myself in the lead as we approached the bridge.  It was at this point I realised I was being silly and backed off a bit and settled into a pace of around 4:00/km - the pace I planned on running the whole race at. To be honest, I don&#39;t think I could have kept up a pace much quicker thanks to my blistering start.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That said, I can&#39;t really grumble too much about my fast start as it meant I managed to smash a whopping 28 seconds off my time from last week setting a new personal best (PB).  The overall pace of the race was a bit slower this week too, but I think everyone still had a great run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/Results/WeeklyResults.aspx?runSeqNumber=36&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; this week were:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 19:41&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Overall Position:&lt;/strong&gt; 14 / 127&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Age Category Position:&lt;/strong&gt; 3rd&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think that&#39;s a good bit of speed work in preparation for Wednesday&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yateley10kseries.info/&quot;&gt;Yateley 10k&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;ll be doing that barefoot (though probably not anywhere near as fast as this 5k) so if you&#39;re there, watch out for the crazy fool - I&#39;ll be the one in the red shirt &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and don&#39;t forget: &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/follow-the-comrades-marathon-online&quot;&gt;Comrades online&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Reading Parkrun Barefoot</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/reading-parkrun-barefoot\"/>\n   <updated>2010-05-23T09:36:08+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/reading-parkrun-barefoot</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Check it out, some crazy nutter did the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/&quot;&gt;Reading Parkrun&lt;/a&gt; yesterday morning completely barefoot...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Reading Parkrun - 22 May 2010&quot; src=&quot;/assets/BarefootParkrun.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;345&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And that nutter was &lt;strong&gt;ME&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .  Yes folks, I have now technically done my first race in over 10 years and I did it barefoot. I opted for a mostly grassy 5k and it was fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;I&#39;ve been contemplating doing the Reading Parkrun for a while now however have always been put off by the weather or the fact I had to make my decision to run by 6pm the night before.  Not anymore.  On Friday morning I heard the weather was due to be glorious this weekend, so I thought I&#39;d register for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Parkrun&lt;/a&gt; this weekend and give it a go.  Well, things have changed since I last considered doing the Parkrun as now you only need to register once, print off your barcode and take it along to ANY Parkrun in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.com/events.aspx&quot;&gt;country&lt;/a&gt;.  No more pre-registering the night before. Just turn up, run, and flash your barcode when they register your finish position.  Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So with myself registered and barcode printed, my wife and I got up early on Saturday morning and cycled down to Thames Valley Park.  The weather was wonderful, as predicted, and there was quite a turnout. Apparently there were a record 115 entrants in yesterday&#39;s run.  At 9am we were promptly started and things got off with a blistering pace. I somehow managed to get a little caught up in the excitement of it all and started off a little too quickly, but I soon settled into a comfortable pace and finished in a time of 20:09 - waaaaaay quicker than I was expecting.  I was only aiming for somewhere around 23:00, so I&#39;m chuffed to bits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, I suspect a lot of my great time has to do with the fact that the course is mostly grass.  There is a short section with a gravel path, but most of this has nice grassy verges so there&#39;s not need to continually run on the gravel.  The gravel wasn&#39;t completely avoidable but I didn&#39;t really have any issues with the sections I couldn&#39;t avoid.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/Results/WeeklyResults.aspx?runSeqNumber=35&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; were:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 20:09&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Overall Position:&lt;/strong&gt; 16 / 115&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Age Category Position:&lt;/strong&gt; 5th&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all it was a great run and I&#39;m glad to have done it.  I think I may have to get my bare feet down there more often too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and for those who don&#39;t know anything about Parkruns, essentially they are free relatively informal timed 5k runs run in parks all over the country, open to anyone and everyone (provided you&#39;re pre-registered and got your barcode).

It&#39;s being run a week Sunday (30 May 2010) so start planning your lives now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last year was the first time it was done and it was a resounding success and this year the organisers plan on building on that by offering online coverage again, and constant Twitter updates at &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/comradesm2010&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/comradesm2010&lt;/a&gt; along with the usual TV and radio coverage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The race is a bit of a tradition in South Africa and my family.  Even if you&#39;re not competing, you&#39;re almost certain to know someone who is, so almost everyone spends the day following the events on TV or the radio.  Not being in South Africa anymore, this was a tradition I&#39;ve had to miss out on, but not anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This year&#39;s down run (from Pietermaritzburg to Durban) is sure to be a bumper one.  It&#39;s the 85th running of the race and it&#39;s drawn a whopping 23565 entries of which about 92% are expected to make it to the start line. If the past is anything to go by, we can expect well over 17500 finishers (about 75%).  That is just phenomenal and you can certainly understand why Comrades is the world&#39;s largest ultra-marathon. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Comrades is now back on my list of to-dos, though not sure I&#39;ll do it barefoot.  My cousin, &lt;a href=&quot;http://results.comrades.com/History.aspx?AthleteId=60451&quot;&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt;, and two of my uncles (&lt;a href=&quot;http://results.comrades.com/History.aspx?AthleteId=1534&quot;&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://results.comrades.com/History.aspx?AthleteId=25196&quot;&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt;) have run it several times each and it&#39;s about time another member of the Seymour family ran it.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Getting Michael Sandler&#39;s Barefoot Running Book in the UK</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/getting-michael-sandlers-barefoot-running-book-in-the-uk\"/>\n   <updated>2010-05-19T17:31:53+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/getting-michael-sandlers-barefoot-running-book-in-the-uk</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; alt=&quot;Barefoot Running Book&quot; src=&quot;/assets/Barefoot-Running-Book.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;215&quot; /&gt;I&#39;ve just attempted to get my hands on Michael Sandler&#39;s book &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barefootrunningbook.com/&quot;&gt;Barefoot Running: How to Run Light and Free by Getting in Touch with the Earth&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and it&#39;s proving to be a bit of a mission, unless my money tree starts growing, and quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The book has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runbare.com/597/barefoot-running-the-book-is-out/&quot;&gt;just been released&lt;/a&gt; and the reviews of the book are starting to popup all over the barefoot and minimalist running websites.  I consider myself to be a seasoned barefoot runner now, but I&#39;m eager to have a read through this book to see how closely my experience has been to that of the author&#39;s and also to see if I&#39;ve missed some &quot;magic trick&quot; or other little useful snippet that would help improve my barefoot running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- more --&gt;So, the first place I hit was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0984382208?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=costest-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0984382208&quot;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve got a gift voucher that isn&#39;t transferable to Amazon.co.uk so thought I&#39;d use it for this book. Nope.  Sadly, the book isn&#39;t sold directly by Amazon, but rather by the publisher and they won&#39;t ship to the UK via Amazon.  The book also isn&#39;t available via Amazon.co.uk, nor any of the other European equivalents. So it&#39;s to the book&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barefootrunningbook.com/&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, that&#39;s a bit of a dead end too - the cost of the P&amp;P is nearly as much as the book.  The book costs $24.95 and P&amp;P to the UK is $19.95.  Add to this the fact the Pound is sliding against the Dollar, by the time the book arrives in the UK I could soon find myself in the position where the book costs more than £18 and thus becomes liable to import duties (not VAT as books are exempt) and thus I&#39;d have paid more than double the price for the book.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Eager to find out if there is anyway I can get this in the UK without it costing me twice as much, I&#39;ve used the book site&#39;s contact form to find out.  I&#39;ll update you when I hear back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, if anyone knows of somewhere in Europe that is selling this book, then please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update - 19 May @ 18:30&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, Jessica Lee of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runbare.com&quot;&gt;RunBare&lt;/a&gt; has replied to my email already (I love it when people are prompt repliers):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;From\tJessica Lee\r\nTo\tColin Seymour\r\nDate\tWed, May 19, 2010 at 5:42 PM\r\nSubject\tRE: Purchasing from the UK\r\n\r\nHi Colin,\r\n\r\nI&#39;m sorry for your troubles.

I&#39;m sure most of them give it a fleeting thought whilst we&#39;re discussing it and then shrug it off with the thought &quot;daft fool&quot;.  Well, not my wife.  Whilst she isn&#39;t into running and isn&#39;t likely to pick it up any time soon, she is supportive and she made me smile yesterday. Whilst driving home from my sister-in-law&#39;s, we passed a runner and out of the blue my wife nodded in his direction and said &quot;&lt;em&gt;Lose the shoes you woofta&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Review: Terra Plana VivoBarefoot Evo Running Shoes</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/review-terra-plana-vivobarefoot-evo-running-shoes\"/>\n   <updated>2010-04-27T13:44:09+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/review-terra-plana-vivobarefoot-evo-running-shoes</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-Top-Bottom/842832496_uySwx-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; src=&quot;/assets/842832496_uySwx-90x90.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo Running Shoes&quot; width=&quot;90&quot; height=&quot;90&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Following on from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/review-vivobarefoot-aqua-by-terra-plana&quot;&gt;review of the VivoBarefoot Aqua shoes by Terra Plana&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve been kindly sent a pair of the much talked about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/evo-p-1263.html&quot;&gt;VivoBarefoot Evo&lt;/a&gt; running shoes for review and critique and fast approaching two months after &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/look-what-arrived-for-me-today&quot;&gt;receiving&lt;/a&gt; them (I&#39;ve been a busy boy) I&#39;m finally getting around to documenting my experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Box&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve already got some shoes from Terra Plana (or read my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/review-vivobarefoot-aqua-by-terra-plana&quot;&gt;previous review&lt;/a&gt;), the box and it&#39;s contents won&#39;t come as much of a surprise to you.  As with the Aquas, the shoes come individually wrapped and beautifully presented in a box which encourages you to recycle or reuse it.  For those who like to see the contents, here you go...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-Whats-In-The/842832312_bdFnX-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/842832312_bdFnX-500x430.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo: What&#39;s in the Box&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Initial Observations&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-Side-Close-up/842832952_vbjSZ-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; src=&quot;/assets/842832952_vbjSZ-Th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo: Lacing&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First thing you&#39;ll notice is, unlike a lot of it&#39;s competitors, the VivoBarefoot Evos actually look like the running shoes you&#39;re used to seeing.  They have a very low profile, thanks to the very thin soles, feature a normal lacing system including the two eyes at the top so you can use your favourite &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/lacingmethods.htm&quot;&gt;lacing methods&lt;/a&gt; and generally don&#39;t look too dissimilar to a pair of racing flats.  You may also find yourself a little disappointed by the fact you don&#39;t get much in the way of padding, foam, rubber and fancy torsion or motion control systems for your £100 ($160).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Fit&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the initial observations out of the way, it was time to try them on. I didn&#39;t have much of a sizing &quot;experience&quot; with these as the lady who sent me the Aquas already had my size so the Evos came pre-sized and are a good fit.  The sizing of the Evos appears to be consistent with that of the Aquas, however you may want to get a size smaller if you&#39;re going to run in them without the insoles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The fit itself is good.  It&#39;s very comfortable with a relatively snug fit around the heel and midfoot and quite a spacious toebox, though not as spacious as the Aquas.  I suspect this can be attributed to the fact they&#39;re trying to make these look like running shoes and a super-wide toebox like on the aquas may look a little silly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The only &quot;issue&quot; I have with the fit, and it&#39;s more of an observation than an issue, is that the soles have a slight arch; the marketing calls it a  &quot;&lt;em&gt;sucked out arch area&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.  Unfortunately, this can be felt when wearing the shoes.  I only notice this because I&#39;ve been spending so much time completely barefoot or in the Aquas in which you can&#39;t feel this.  The arch isn&#39;t supportive in anyway so it&#39;s not going anything, however it&#39;s presence may lead to rubbing on longer runs.  Removing the insoles reduces the feeling, but doesn&#39;t take it away completely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-On-From-The/842833769_MZZcA-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/842833769_MZZcA-500x228.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo: How they look on me&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;228&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Construction&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Evos, like the Aquas, are immaculately constructed.  There are no distinguishable differences between the two shoes (bar the fact one&#39;s a left and one&#39;s a right) and no signs of sloppy or rushed construction.  They are relatively light and come in at about 271g with the insoles and 243g without (this is actually an average as the left weighs 10g more than the right for some reason) and there really isn&#39;t much to them.  The sole is 1mm thicker than the Aquas at 4mm throughout with absolutely no heel elevation what-so-ever.  The upper consists of a highly breathable &lt;acronym title=&quot;thermoplastic polyurethane&quot;&gt;TPU&lt;/acronym&gt; cage that is so breathable in fact that you can almost see straight through it.  Naturally this means the shoes are not water resistant, but then again, which running shoes are? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-Side/842833139_zcV7D-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/842833139_zcV7D-Th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo - TPU cage from the outside&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-TPU-Cage-1/842832754_uVpQE-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/842832754_uVpQE-Th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo - TPU cage from the inside (1)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-TPU-Cage-2/842832624_vEPPX-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/842832624_vEPPX-Th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo - TPU cage from the inside (2)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The sole of the shoes is a lot more rugged than the Aquas and pretty much all of the other minimalist running shoes on the market, however it does offer some additional grip in the wet and off road without too much loss of flexibility or ground feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What I couldn&#39;t answer by looking at the shoes was why they weigh so much when there&#39;s so little to them?.  A pair of mid-to-top of the range racing flats come in at about 100g lighter.  Maybe they&#39;ll lighten as they evolve.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Performance&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And finally we get to the part you&#39;re reading this review for: how do the Evos perform when you actually run in them? Very well indeed.  If you&#39;ve run in racing flats, they perform just as well, if not better.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the shoes protect your feet from the friction and coarseness of the road and that&#39;s about it.  There&#39;s no motion control, no arch support, no cushioning and no fancy gimmicks designed to make your feet behave like the manufacturer thinks they should.  The Evos allow your feet to behave as your feet want to behave with as little intervention from the shoe as possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-Sole-Next-To/842833461_uG9nk-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; src=&quot;/assets/842833461_uG9nk-Th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo Sole vs the VivoBarefoot Aqua Sole&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The thin soles do a good job of softening the landing on some of the larger rocks and stones that may affect your stride when running barefoot, however they don&#39;t dampen things so much as to not give you any ground feedback at all.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s very close to what you&#39;d get from wearing Vibrams with the Vibrams giving a slightly higher degree of feedback.  That said, the slightly thicker and more rugged sole of the Evos trump the Vibrams when it comes to running on very stoney off-road paths.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you can expect the ground feedback is affected by the insoles.  I&#39;ve taken the Evos out a couple of times with and without the insoles and I prefer them without the insoles, mainly because I actually noticed my feet hitting the ground slightly harder with the insoles than without; almost subliminally searching for the feedback.  This wasn&#39;t anywhere near as what I&#39;d expect my feet to do in normal shoes, but given I&#39;ve been running exclusively barefoot since the beginning of February, I noticed it if I concentrated.  If you&#39;re coming from running in normal shoes or racing flats, you&#39;ll appreciate the slightly extra cushioning that the insoles provide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is however one problem when it comes to running in the Evos: blisters.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In my first run in the Evos, I developed a smaller blister on my left heel.  I thought this may have been due to not running in shoes for a while, but it seems several other people have encountered this problem in their first few runs.  The incidence of the heel blisters seems to subside as the shoes wear and I didn&#39;t get any blisters on my heel on subsequent runs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The second and most notable incidence of blisters, and this is certainly the most common issue seen, is blisters or bruising on the top of either your big toe or the toe next to it.  When running, your foot naturally bends at the toes.  The TPU cage here creases inwards and presses against your toes. After several miles of this, you soon start to feel it and if you continue, as I did, you may develop a bruise and possibly a blister or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/Other/Clips/VivoBarefoot-Evo-Posed/842834291_sq27T-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/842834291_sq27T-500x333.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo: In a mid-stride pose - notice the creasing over the toes&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Terra Plana have acknowledged both of these issues and have apparently been back to the drawing board to resolve this in later releases of the shoes.  There&#39;s already talk on the haurache (note to self, I must make/get myself a pair of these) forum &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/huaraches/msg/6256d3ef23cdb76b&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; of the later editions looking ever-so slightly different around the heel and inside above the toes than the earlier version. If you have one of the early versions, you may find using a bit of moleskin fabric on the heel and above the toes as detailed &lt;a href=&quot;http://hhollines.blogspot.com/2010/03/evo-blister-solution.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; will solve your problems.  Hey, you could always try beg and plead with Terra Plana and see if they&#39;ll swap them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Summary&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Based on the early model I have tested, I can summarise the pros and cons as I see them as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Superb quality build and design.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Very thin soles throughout with no heel lift so the ground feedback is very good.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No support anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wide on the forefoot so your feet and toes can splay naturally.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They look like normal running shoes so will appeal to the more conscious runner.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cost.  Terra Plana know they&#39;re in a bit of a unique position in a niche market and have priced accordingly. Once competition picks up, I envisage the price of the Evos may come down.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The early revision is likely to cause blisters on the heel and on top of the toes and thus may require modification.  This con is probably moot given Terra Plana appear to have addressed this issue in later versions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Slightly narrow in midfoot, but this is likely to just be a personal thing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Whilst relatively lightweight, I can&#39;t help but feel they should be lighter especially.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re not barefoot - I had to put this one in there &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So all in all, these are fantastic minimalist shoes and definitely ones I&#39;d recommend to anyone looking to move away from wearing traditional running shoes or any barefoot runner looking for a minimalist shoe to run in offroad or in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">100km Per Month</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/100km-per-month\"/>\n   <updated>2010-04-26T18:18:01+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/100km-per-month</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just uploaded today&#39;s run to FetchEveryone and noticed I&#39;ve clocked over 100km in a single month for the first time since my return to running, and the month isn&#39;t even over yet.

Whilst it&#39;s great to see barefoot running getting an article in Runner&#39;s World, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m too impressed with the overall slant of the article nor some of the points and quotes made.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;I&#39;m a bit late publishing this post as I&#39;ve been waiting patiently for permission to reproduce the article (I&#39;ve made a PDF copy) to accompany this post.  Sadly, my request has been completely ignored so you&#39;ll have to do with the pictures someone else has kindly put up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/wrigleyjw/sets/72157623428426621/&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; (these may disappear).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The article starts off by giving you an idea of exactly how open the author is to the concept of barefoot running - he&#39;s not.  He&#39;d definitely prefer shelling out for &quot;&lt;em&gt;expensive, rubberised contraptions that make the business of running from A to B a comfortable, fashionable, pleasurable experience.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;  Fair enough, everyone is entitled to their opinions, but unfortunately, this puts a negative bias on the article right at the very beginning and the bias continues through the whole article. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the tone set, the author gives a relatively brief account of why barefoot running is seeing a lot more publicity recently with a nod to &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/book-born-to-run-by-christopher-mcdougall&quot;&gt;Born to Run&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/my-thoughts-on-the-lieberman-paper&quot;&gt;Lieberman paper&lt;/a&gt; and several other studies dealing with the possible benefits of running barefoot.  It&#39;s in this section that &lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/&quot;&gt;Barefoot Ken Bob Saxton&lt;/a&gt; and I, the only completely barefoot runners in the whole article, are quoted. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then the article moves onto quoting Dr Reed Ferber of the Running Injury Clinic at the University of Calgary:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see so many patients book appointments on Mondays because they took a weekend camp to do barefoot running and literally ran a few hundred kilometres with no shoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Surely this can&#39;t be true or accurate.  I think Dr Ferber may have been seriously misquoted, quoted out of context or he&#39;s really anti-barefoot running. If it is true and these camps exist, then someone needs to be shot.  Either the people running the camps who are trying to make a quick buck without actually thinking, or those who are attending these camps thinking they&#39;ll emerge injury free barefoot runners in two short days. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;No matter how good a runner you are in shoes, you&#39;re can&#39;t expect to continue at the same rate when you kick off your shoes.  Your feet will be weak and unconditioned after years of being shielded by the shoes you&#39;ve been running in.  You wouldn&#39;t take a fat couch potato and make him run the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nycmarathon.org/&quot;&gt;New York City Marathon&lt;/a&gt;, swim the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midmarmile.co.za/&quot;&gt;MidMar Mile&lt;/a&gt; (the worlds largest open water race) or cycle the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.letour.fr/&quot;&gt;Tour de France&lt;/a&gt; without any training and adaptation - why would you do the equivalent with barefoot running?  Thankfully the article does cover this angle later on with several excerpts from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildfitness.com/special/lee_saxby.htm&quot;&gt;Lee Saxby&lt;/a&gt;, a barefoot running and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.posetech.com/&quot;&gt;POSE method&lt;/a&gt; coach, who emphasises that barefoot running requires a period of transition, and I couldn&#39;t agree more.  On a side note, I missed an opportunity to meet Lee at the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/evo-p-1263.html&quot;&gt;VivoBarefoot Evo&lt;/a&gt; (review coming soon) kick-off breakfast run in London due to commitments relating to the recent death of my daughter. Maybe I&#39;ll get the opportunity another day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The article finishes off with the general summary that barefoot running should only really be used as a tool in your training toolbox, that it&#39;s not some magic miracle cure and that it shouldn&#39;t be a lifestyle choice.  I agree mostly with this, but I certainly wouldn&#39;t suggest ruling it out as a &quot;lifestyle choice&quot;.  I think this is something everyone should assess for themselves.  I&#39;ve chosen this route, but it doesn&#39;t mean you have to.  The only way you&#39;ll be able to tell if this is really something you want to do long term or if it&#39;ll have any effect in preventing your common running injuries is to actually get out there and do it consistently - take a whole season to give it a proper go as one or two runs a week on grass won&#39;t really give you a good idea.  Of course, if barefoot running isn&#39;t for you, then by all means carry on running in shoes, but do make sure you bung in a couple of runs barefoot if you can - barefoot running on golf courses is glorious.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and I wouldn&#39;t waste my time with the strengthening exercise detailed on the last page. I don&#39;t think these will prepare you for the rigours of barefoot running.  The only way you&#39;ll be able to strengthen you calves, feet and stabilising muscles for barefoot running is by running barefoot.  The exercises listed are just not specific enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So in summary, I think the article is good in that is brings a bit of attention to barefoot running in a mainstream magazine and it may be just enough to persuade a couple more people to give it a go, but sadly it&#39;s a little biased against taking it up whole-hog.  This isn&#39;t surprising considering most of the money made from Runner&#39;s World comes from advertising, in particular shoe advertising, so they won&#39;t want to be seen to shoot themselves in the foot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Have a read of the article and make up your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Trying Out dailymile</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/trying-out-dailymile\"/>\n   <updated>2010-03-24T18:29:17+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/trying-out-dailymile</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;dailymile_badge_143x56_grey.png&quot; src=&quot;/assets/dailymile_badge_143x56_grey.png&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; width=&quot;143&quot; height=&quot;56&quot; /&gt;I&#39;ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/&quot;&gt;Fetcheveryone&lt;/a&gt; to log all my running since July 2009 and overall I&#39;m quite pleased with it. I recently discovered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymile.com/&quot;&gt;dailymile&lt;/a&gt; and it certainly looks very pretty (lots of Web2.0rhea) but I&#39;m not convinced by the whole idea of &quot;social training&quot; or whatever they want to call it nor dailymile&#39;s overall functionality and behaviour. It seems lacking and buggy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;When developing the the &quot;Latest Training&quot; section in my sidebar, I went hunting for some other site that offers some sort of official widget or gadget to display recent training etc in my site&#39;s sidebar.  This is how I stumbled upon dailymile.  It&#39;s got a few interesting widgets so I signed up and hit my first hurdle - no Garmin import support.  I quite like and now rely on the import functionality Fetcheveryone has and I now deem it an essential. Accordingly, I put things on hold and didn&#39;t even bother trying to use dailymile.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This week I discovered dailymile have finally introduced Garmin import support (beta still): it imports it from the incredibly useless &lt;a href=&quot;http://connect.garmin.com/&quot;&gt;Garmin Connect&lt;/a&gt;.  With this news, I imported all my training from Garmin.  So far so good.  It seemed to work quite well, though it didn&#39;t import any of the limited notes I put up on Garmin Connect. It seems to have just imported the raw GPS data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, with my runs imported I manually set to updating each one and copying my notes across from Fetcheveryone into each run. I then manually entered all this year&#39;s runs from Fetcheveryone.  It was during all this laborious work that I realised I don&#39;t think dailymile is for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My current annoyances are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can&#39;t independently import routes from anywhere - not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mapmyrun.com/&quot;&gt;MapMyRun&lt;/a&gt;, not Fetcheveryone, not from a GPX or TPX file or even directly from your Garmin device unless it&#39;s part of importing a run.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What routes you do have, you can&#39;t completely hide.  They&#39;re either viewable by everyone or just your friends.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can&#39;t import previous training data from any external source, not even a simple CSV file - this leads to the ball-arch that is manually importing all your data.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can&#39;t export any of your training, in case you want to switch to somewhere else, or even just so you can perform you own local analysis.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The website is trying to live up to the hype that is Web 2.0, but sadly this doesn&#39;t always work. The javascript that powers most of the site stops responding so you have to refresh the page to give it a kick.  This happens on Safari, Firefox and Chrome, all on a Mac.  I&#39;ve not tested on other operating systems, but I doubt it&#39;ll be any better.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You can&#39;t edit your &quot;gear&quot; entries, or if you can, it&#39;s certainly not intuitive and I didn&#39;t find out how short of adding a new item and removing the old.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The preferences and settings are not all centralised in one place. You have to hunt around for the various settings.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not all bad.  I quite like the idea of their widgets, the fact the site isn&#39;t smothered in advertising and it&#39;s fresh modern look, though it could do with looking a lot less like Facebook in places, but that&#39;s about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My only issues, and these are really just niggles, with Fetcheveryone are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;it&#39;s not the prettiest of sites&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the &quot;Barefoot&quot; shoe type doesn&#39;t show up in the sidebar (I like to be able to quickly glance and see how much of my running has been barefoot)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; and there are no widgets for easy sharing of data onto any other site, though they do offer several methods to export different data.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise everything it intuitive and seems to just work and work well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not going to stop using dailymile just yet. I&#39;ll keep entering data on it for a while longer to see if it grows on me and to see if the issues I&#39;ve highlighted are resolved anytime soon (I&#39;m not holding my breath though as the Garmin import support took forever to arrive, despite being advertised as &quot;coming soon&quot; since dailymile&#39;s inception). Time will tell. Until then, I think I&#39;ll keep hacking away at my own &quot;widgets&quot; for Fetcheveryone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over all I think dailymile is aimed more at the Facebook/Twitter addicted fun runners who want to natter than those who want a highly functional and detailed online location to store their training runs.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Siraj Gena Wins Rome Marathon BAREFOOT</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/siraj-gena-wins-rome-marathon-barefoot\"/>\n   <updated>2010-03-21T17:53:48+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/siraj-gena-wins-rome-marathon-barefoot</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Seeing is believing...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Siraj Gena finishing the 2010 Rome Marathon barefoot&quot; src=&quot;/assets/SirajGena-RomeMarathon-2010.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;594&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, almost.

It&#39;s dry and sunny with a slight cool breeze blowing.  I&#39;d planned on going for a long run later today once the roads had warmed up a bit, but when I saw how gorgeous it was outside, I couldn&#39;t hold myself back and headed out a little earlier than planned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What a fantastic run.  I&#39;d originally planned on only running about 8km, but before I knew it I&#39;d already clocked up 6km and was about 4km from home.  I could probably have carried on further, but given 8km was my previous longest barefoot run, I thought it best to head back home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I got home, I sync&#39;d up my Garmin Forerunner 405CX (note to self, I really should write about my new toy some time) with Garmin Connect (leaves a lot to be desired, but it happens automatically) and my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/userprofile.php?id=32814&amp;show=training&quot;&gt;FetchEveryone&lt;/a&gt; account.  Whilst checking my log on FetchEveryone I noticed I&#39;d managed to tick off two of my goals this week:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;20km per week in training completely barefoot&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;10km long training run&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m quite chuffed with this and believe it&#39;s all down to switching to ONLY running barefoot since the beginning of February.  This has definitely allowed me to run further and with more ease than when switching between Vibrams and barefoot. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, on a side note: if you want to check your barefoot form, head down to &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Thames+Valley+Park&amp;sll=53.800651,-4.064941&amp;sspn=23.701453,45.131836&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=Thames+Valley+Park&amp;hnear=Thames+Valley+Park&amp;z=15&amp;iwloc=A&quot;&gt;Thames Valley Park&lt;/a&gt;.  The grassy bit along the Thames where they do the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parkrun.org.uk/reading/Home.aspx&quot;&gt;Reading Park Run&lt;/a&gt; (on my todo list) is very wet and soggy in places.  You&#39;ll very easily be able to tell if your pushing off or landing incorrectly as your feet slip and slosh through all the mud &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; .  On the plus side, I think it&#39;s quite a magical feeling feeling the mud squelch between my toes.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">I&#39;m Back Online</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/back-online\"/>\n   <updated>2010-02-28T16:05:55+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/back-online</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Well folks, I&#39;m back online and trying to get back into the groove again. I technically wasn&#39;t completely offline, just lacking the motivation to write or get involved due to recent events on the home front.  Sadly, February has been a very tough month for my wife and I: our baby daughter, Lara, unfortunately didn&#39;t make it through the open heart surgery she had to undergo in order to rectify two congenital heart defects.  I&#39;m not going to go into the details here but if you&#39;re interested, I will be posting a series of posts, building up to my daughter&#39;s funeral on 12 March, on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.co.uk/&quot;&gt;main site&lt;/a&gt;. Suffice to say we were devastated and completely knocked for six by this, even though we&#39;d known about the heart condition before she was born.  The loss of a child is something you really can&#39;t prepare yourself for no matter how much forewarning you received.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;I&#39;ve now had several weeks to grieve and I think I&#39;m starting to come to terms with it all and am getting my motivation back.  I&#39;m back into the office tomorrow so we&#39;ll see how I get on.  On the plus side, I have still been running - it&#39;s a brilliant tool for coping with stress, anger, sadness and the loss of a loved one - and completely barefoot too.   Yes, EVERY ONE of the 41.45 kilometers run this month have been completely barefoot and I&#39;ve loved it.  My feet are toughening up beautifully and I&#39;m sure every run is getting easier and more comfortable.  That said I do sometimes doubt it when heading out in the cold and wet: these are still the toughies which tend to result in a blister or two on a few of my toes but they&#39;re very quickly outweighed by the ease and comfort of the dry warmer runs.  I&#39;m really looking forward to summer when all my runs will be in the warm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; alt=&quot;Terra Plana EVO&quot; src=&quot;/assets/evo.jpg&quot; /&gt;The last week has also been quite an eventful one in the barefoot running world thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com&quot;&gt;Terra Plana&lt;/a&gt;. They&#39;ve just released the first ever barefoot running shoe, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/the-evo&quot;&gt;VivoBarefoot EVO&lt;/a&gt; (remember all the other minimalist shoes we use weren&#39;t originally designed with barefoot running in mind).  I gave everyone a &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/vivobarefoot-evo-running-shoes-sneak-peak&quot;&gt;sneak peak&lt;/a&gt; before and now they&#39;re finally available to buy.  I&#39;ve not put in my order yet as I&#39;m still debating with myself as to if I buy another pair of Vibrams (I really like my Classics), get my grubby paws on a pair of these bad boys or skip the shoes completely.  Initial reviews of the EVOs (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hhollines.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Harry here&lt;/a&gt; is giddy with excitement about the EVOs &lt;a href=&quot;http://hhollines.blogspot.com/2010/02/im-wearing-my-evos.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://hhollines.blogspot.com/2010/02/thank-you-evo.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hhollines.blogspot.com/2010/02/evo-review-longhard-run.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) have been very positive and it sounds like Terra Plana may have just hit the nail on the head with the EVOs and at the same time being the first to market in what could potentially be a very lucrative niche.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Terra Plana do however have one potential thorn in their side with the EVOs - the price.  Whilst £100 is quite reasonable and competitive in the UK where a pair of Vibram FiveFinger Classics cost about £90; $160 is just extortionate in the US where a pair of Classics cost about $75 (ignoring discounts and voucher codes).  That said, it&#39;s quite refreshing to see product prices vaguely taking into account the exchange rates. So often we see products sold for $100 in the US and then sold for £100 in the UK.  Anyway, time will tell how successful Terra Plana are in coaxing people away from highly cushioned and supportive Nike/Adidas/Asics/Brooks/whatever shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve shelled out for the EVOs, I&#39;d be happy to hear how you find them.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">My Thoughts on The Lieberman Paper</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/my-thoughts-on-the-lieberman-paper\"/>\n   <updated>2010-02-02T12:34:12+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/my-thoughts-on-the-lieberman-paper</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; alt=&quot;The cover of the &#39;Nature&#39; journal for Jan 2010&quot; src=&quot;/assets/NatureCoverJan2010.jpg&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;198&quot; /&gt;I&#39;ve finally managed to get my hands on The Lieberman &quot;letter&quot;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7280/full/nature08723.html&quot;&gt;Foot strike patterns and collision forces in habitually barefoot versus shod runners&lt;/a&gt; reported in January&#39;s edition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; and I&#39;ve read through it, the accompanying &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunning.fas.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Harvard site&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of the reviews other people have made, and here are my observations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I believe this paper has been over-hyped and misinterpreted (possibly deliberately as it makes &quot;good news&quot;) in a big way.  I think the main reason for this is it&#39;s the first major research paper in years that actually involves comparisons between barefoot and shod runners.  There have been other recent studies that have documented the merits of different foot strikes (fore/mid/heel), but none have made the comparison between barefoot and shod runners.  There&#39;s also the added attention barefoot running is currently enjoying thanks to Christopher McDougall&#39;s book: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1861978235/?tag=costest-21&quot;&gt;Born to Run&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/book-born-to-run-by-christopher-mcdougall&quot;&gt;my review&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;The paper itself doesn&#39;t provide anything particularly new, at least for someone who has already made the transition from running in shoes to barefoot, or who has watched the running style and landing of runners of varying degrees of age, speed and profession.  What is does do is officially put some science behind the anecdotal evidence many barefoot runners talk about with regards to impact and foot strike when running barefoot.  This is the &quot;&lt;em&gt;I told you so&lt;/em&gt;&quot; part I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/ive-not-missed-the-lieberman-paper&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think most people and the media are reading a lot more into this paper than the authors are actually stating and not actually reading what&#39;s right in front of them.  Essentially, the paper is only documenting and comparing their observations on...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;foot strike patterns in shod and barefoot Americans and Kenyans (groups 1-5)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;and collision forces in shod and barefoot Americans (groups 1 and 3)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... who have been habitually barefoot or shod.  Nothing more. It&#39;s there in the title: &quot;&lt;em&gt;Foot strike patterns and collision forces in habitually barefoot versus shod runners&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. All corresponding hypotheses about reducing injuries are exactly that - hypotheses.  There is no research (yet) indicating that running barefoot reduces impact related injuries or running in shoes causes injuries.  It only suggests there &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be a correlation and this is the part that I feel the media and most people have hooked onto.  &quot;May&quot; is being treated like &quot;Will&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The authors didn&#39;t really help prevent this by finishing off the paper with...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence that barefoot and minimally shod runners avoid RFS strikes with high-impact collisions may have public health implications. The average runner strikes the ground 600 times per kilometre, making runners prone to repetitive stress injuries. The incidence of such injuries has remained considerable for 30 years despite technological advancements that provide more cushioning and motion control in shoes designed for heel–toe running. Although cushioned, high-heeled running shoes are comfortable, they limit proprioception and make it easier for runners to land on their heels. Furthermore, many running shoes have arch supports and stiffened soles that may lead to weaker foot muscles, reducing arch strength. This weakness contributes to excessive pronation and places greater demands on the plantar fascia, which may cause plantar fasciitis. Although there are anecdotal reports of reduced injuries in barefoot populations, controlled prospective studies are needed to test the hypothesis that individuals who do not predominantly RFS either barefoot or in minimal footwear, as the foot apparently evolved to do, have reduced injury rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this is a bit of a sensational closing paragraph which has just the right ring to it to catch the media&#39;s attention with the last sentence being ignored in most reports I&#39;ve seen.  Thankfully, the authors have acknowledged that their paper has been misinterpreted by the media on the first page of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunning.fas.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;supporting website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The supporting &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunning.fas.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; itself covers the much broader topic of barefoot running and it&#39;s merits.  It draws on and references material from this and other studies to help put together a good single resource for people curious in the merits of running barefoot.  It does emphasis in several places that this is really only for informational purposes and does not constitute a definitive statement on the best way to run or the effects on injury.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So whilst this paper doesn&#39;t actually document anything new, I feel it will start the ball rolling on more controversial and potentially sensational research.  I think this study it just the stepping stone needed for others to actually research the effects of running in shoes vs running barefoot with respect to injuries and performance.  I do have one slight reservation with stating this though: in this litigious world, would the running shoe manufacturers actually allow such research to see the light of day if it proves shoes are causing more harm than not?&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">I&#39;ve Not Missed the Lieberman Paper</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/ive-not-missed-the-lieberman-paper\"/>\n   <updated>2010-01-29T20:39:41+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/ive-not-missed-the-lieberman-paper</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note to say, no, I&#39;ve not been sleeping under a rock (sleep, what&#39;s that?).

From the little bit I&#39;ve read in various locations, my initial thoughts are: &quot;&lt;em&gt;It&#39;s about bloody time some one published a modern paper detailing one/some of the benefits of barefoot running&lt;/em&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;em&gt;I told you so&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, but this is only based on second hand information.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Time for a beer, dinner, relaxation, and maybe some reading of this study on my iPod Touch instead of TV tonight, though I do now have a two rather interesting books to read too: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Brain-Training-Runners-Revolutionary-Endurance/dp/0451222326/?tag=costest-21&quot;&gt;Brain Training For Runners&lt;/a&gt; (I love subjects involving using the brain to better our lives - think &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb%255Fsb%255Fnoss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3DTony%2520Buzan%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Dstripbooks&amp;tag=costest-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&quot;&gt;Tony Buzan&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-We-Run-Natural-History/dp/0060958707/?tag=costest-21&quot;&gt;Why We Run&lt;/a&gt;.

Whilst timid, these guys shouldn&#39;t be snubbed as they tend to hear you long before you see them and they&#39;re long gone by the time you get within smelling distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Previously when running in shoes, I might catch a glimpse of a one of these animals in the distance and then watch then run off. Now, when running barefoot or in my Vibrams, I find I can get very close before they hear me and get a good look before they dash off.  Sometimes the animal doesn&#39;t even dash off, but instead stops and watches me like I&#39;m the wild animal - this has happened on numerous occasions with deer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&#39;s now quite common for me to get within a few meters of a squirrels before they hear me, and even then they don&#39;t bolt like they used to.  Most of them move slightly out of my way and then turn and watch my feet just like humans do, and probably with the same thought crossing their mind - Crazy fool!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy the encounters I now make with the best of Britain&#39;s wildlife, and it&#39;s all thanks to getting rid of the shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">What To Wear When You Run</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/what-to-wear-when-you-run\"/>\n   <updated>2010-01-03T13:10:58+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/what-to-wear-when-you-run</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;What Should I wear?&quot; src=&quot;/assets/whattowear.jpg&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If &quot;&lt;em&gt;run regularly&lt;/em&gt;&quot; is on your tentative list of New Year&#39;s resolutions, you may find Runner&#39;s World&#39;s (US) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.com/cda/whattowear/0,7152,s6-240-325-330-0-0-0-0,00.html&quot;&gt;What Should I Wear?&lt;/a&gt; calculator may help you pick appropriate attire.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just bung in the temperature, wind speed, and sky conditions, then add how you prefer to feel when you run (cool, in-between, warm) and it&#39;ll suggest what you should wear.

Well in retrospect, I don&#39;t think it was a stress fracture at all, rather I believe it was just the muscles and tendons in my feet telling me that I was taking things too fast too soon.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The break from running helped my feet recuperate and allow me to drop a few pounds too.  I was soon however &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/back-on-my-feet&quot;&gt;back on my feet&lt;/a&gt; in mid-February and rearing to go.  I was soon running with a certain degree of regularity in my Vibrams and enjoying it as I slowly increased my fitness and distance.  Nothing too crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then it came - my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-completely-barefoot-run&quot;&gt;first completely barefoot run&lt;/a&gt; in April.  WOW!!! I loved it and was hooked on the feeling of running completely barefoot.  However that wasn&#39;t enough to stop me from trying one more run in shoes.  Bad idea.  It hurt and on 28 May 2009, I drew a line in the sand and stated &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/no-more-shoes&quot;&gt;I would not run in shoes again&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following my declaration, I enjoyed a fabulous &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/two-weeks-of-barefoot-bliss&quot;&gt;shoe-free summer holiday&lt;/a&gt;, switched to a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/review-vivobarefoot-aqua-by-terra-plana&quot;&gt;Vivo Barefoot Aquas&lt;/a&gt; for my general purpose casual shoes, slowly built up my mileage and the strength in my feet and ticked off the first 5 of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals&quot;&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt; as I went along.  I also started recording my runs on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fetcheveryone.com/userprofile.php?id=32814&quot;&gt;FetchEveryone.com&lt;/a&gt; and created a little feed in the sidebar to show off my training and keep me motivated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The year has ended with a bit of a slow down in my running: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/no-more-barefoot-for-this-year&quot;&gt;cold soon ruled out any further barefoot runs&lt;/a&gt; for the year before the wet, snow and holidays all set in to put a further spanner in the works.  I&#39;m not really too concerned about this as everyone needs a break and Christmas time is as good a time as any to take one.  It also helps with the motivation needed for the new year&#39;s resolutions, which brings me nicely onto what I have planned for next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next year is going to start off a bit bumpy: my wife and I are due our first little one in January so when I&#39;m not looking after the baby, the wife or work, I&#39;ll probably be sleeping. I hope to squeeze in some runs where ever possible.  Once things settle down on the home front I&#39;ll start work on attaining some of my goals with the primary goal of completing at least one 10km race completely barefoot and a tentative goal of running a half-marathon in Vibrams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This may not seem like much, but if I manage to achieve both goals, I&#39;ll tick 6, possibly 7, other intermediate goals off my current list and may finish off the year as a regular barefoot runner.  Time will tell, but I&#39;ll certainly keep everyone updated as I progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll finish off by wishing everyone a fabulous new year and I hope you all set yourselves some realistic and achievable goals for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Merry Christmas 2009</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/merry-christmas-2009\"/>\n   <updated>2009-12-25T07:00:00+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/merry-christmas-2009</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Merry Christmas 2009&quot; src=&quot;/assets/MerryChristmas2009-red.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas everyone.

Winter has finally set in and it&#39;s blarrrrry cold outside.  Whilst we in the UK don&#39;t get the extreme cold and snow some other countries get, we do get a lot of rain which doesn&#39;t play well with the freezing cold on bare feet. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now I must say, I&#39;m not wussing out here, it&#39;s all for my own good.  Very cold numb feet just don&#39;t feel the ground anywhere near as well as warmer feet do.  As a result form is likely to go to pot and I&#39;m then likely to rip my feet to shreds without even realising it.   It was quite cold and wet on my last completely barefoot run and my feet took about 15 mins to warm up completely.   It&#39;s much colder now so I don&#39;t expect my feet to warm up at all during a run, unless it&#39;s a very very long run.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All is not lost though: I&#39;m not giving up minimalist running.  I will still be heading out in my Vibrams.  Whilst the Vibrams aren&#39;t waterproof, they do keep my feet sufficiently warm that any moisture that does enter my Vibrams soon warms up without numbing my entire foot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, my feet should be nice and strong come spring when I can kick off my shoes again and return to clocking up the miles completely barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Even Sesame Street Thinks Barefoot Is A Good Thing</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/even-sesame-street-thinks-barefoot-is-ace\"/>\n   <updated>2009-12-03T15:55:06+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/even-sesame-street-thinks-barefoot-is-ace</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;&lt;object classid=&quot;clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000&quot; data=&quot;http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/Z7pU-ygiFPk&amp;amp;amp;hl=en_GB&amp;amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;amp;rel=0&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;295&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/Z7pU-ygiFPk&amp;amp;amp;hl=en_GB&amp;amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;amp;rel=0&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--&gt;&lt;!--[if !IE]&gt;--&gt;\t&lt;object type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; data=&quot;http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/Z7pU-ygiFPk&amp;amp;amp;hl=en_GB&amp;amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;amp;rel=0&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;295&quot;&gt;&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--[if !IE]&gt;--&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;!--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Very catchy little number from Sesame Street encouraging kids to &quot;set your piggies free&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Another Vibram Sizing Tip</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/another-vibram-sizing-tip\"/>\n   <updated>2009-12-01T10:16:14+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/another-vibram-sizing-tip</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Last year I provided a tip on &lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.co.uk/sizing-vibram-five-fingers&quot;&gt;sizing Vibram Five Fingers&lt;/a&gt; based on my own experience.  I&#39;ve now found another &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefoot-running.com/blog/?p=85&quot;&gt;useful tip&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how should they fit? I was told directly (in person) by a Vibram Five Fingers corporate rep to fit the toes just BEHIND THE TOE CAPS or right in that area—obviously with different toe lengths there is going to be some fudging here!  That means there is a decent amount of room between the toes and the end (close to 1/2″) and there may be some bagginess in places depending on your foot volume.  Keep in mind that your foot will swell while you are running so any snugness you feel in the store should be a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course this tip is only useful if you can find a shop that sells Vibrams before you shell out your cash or you have them in your hand.

I saw this guy through the trees catching up to me pretty quick running. I was taking a nice leisurely pace as my feet were sorta sore from 12 miles of walking on concrete and gravel and blacktop yesterday. Once he swings around onto the path I&#39;m on I hear his pace slow up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He comes up next to me &quot;&lt;em&gt;how ya doin?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; he asks. &quot;&lt;em&gt;doing good&lt;/em&gt;&quot; I say and smile politely.&lt;br /&gt;\n&quot;&lt;em&gt;mind if I ask you a question?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; he asks, &quot;&lt;em&gt;sure...&lt;/em&gt;&quot; I glance down at his shoes. &quot;&lt;em&gt;wait, how come you&#39;re wearing shoes!?!?&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He gave me a look like &#39;OK...&#39;&lt;br /&gt;\n&quot;&lt;em&gt;no for real&lt;/em&gt;&quot; I continue &quot;&lt;em&gt;how come you&#39;re wearing shoes?&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n&quot;&lt;em&gt;because.... I don&#39;t wanna hurt my feet....&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n&quot;&lt;em&gt;oh OK... oh sorry, what were you gonna ask?&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n&quot;&lt;em&gt;I was gonna ask how come you&#39;re barefoot.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\n&quot;&lt;em&gt;oh that&#39;s an easy one.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; I say with a full stop.&lt;br /&gt;\nWe go about another hundred feet before he prods for more &quot;&lt;em&gt;so why ARE you barefoot.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\nI shrug &quot;&lt;em&gt;I don&#39;t wanna hurt my feet.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And of course my own experience...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The closest I&#39;ve had was one mum called be &quot;&lt;em&gt;barking mad&lt;/em&gt;&quot; and another, whilst I was out running in the rain, shouted &quot;&lt;em&gt;You&#39;ve left your shoes behind&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, to which I replied &quot;&lt;em&gt;At least they&#39;re not getting wet&lt;/em&gt;&quot; as I padded along barefoot enjoying splashing in the puddles like a child.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Strength Training</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/strength-training\"/>\n   <updated>2009-11-05T17:35:47+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/strength-training</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been two months now since I devised and started my last gym/cardio program - &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/tabata-time&quot;&gt;Tabata Time&lt;/a&gt; - and I think it&#39;s time for a change.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve not really followed my previous program too closely, but rather used it as a guide.  I found I was often too busy or couldn&#39;t be bothered to go to the gym twice a week, and I&#39;ve been adding a lot more running into the mix instead of being a slave to the cardio equipment in the gym.  I have however stuck to the weights part quite well, except for dropping the lunges every now and then as they were having too much of an impact on my running on the first few days that followed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This new program is once again, deemed as a guide for myself, but this time with a concentration on strength.  I don&#39;t want to bulk up too much, but I do want to increase my strength as this will definitely help with the running and when combined with a bit of plyometrics should help me &quot;float&quot; a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;So my plan is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout 1: Chest &amp; Back&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Incline Flyes (pre-exhaust)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 1-3 Incline Dumbell Presses&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Straight Arm Lat Pull Downs (pre-exhaust)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Reverse Grip Lat Pull Downs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Deadlifts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout 2: Legs &amp; Abs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 12-20 Leg Extensions (pre-exhaust)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 12-20 Leg Press&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 12-20 Standing Calf Raises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 12-20 Situps&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout 3: Shoulders &amp; Arms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Dumbbell Lat Raises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Bent Over Dumbbell Lat Raises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Reverse Grip Pulldowns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 6-10 Tricep Pressdowns (pre-exhaust)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1x 3-5 Dips&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now this needs some notes to explain my intentions...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Each rep is performed in a controlled manner over the full range of motion.  No jerking, yanking or using momentum.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Each set is only done to momentary failure.  No more. No less.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Each weight is picked to try and ensure I reach the point of momentary failure within the specified range. If the weight it too light, I&#39;ll keep going until I reach momentary failure and increase the weight next time.  If too heavy, lower the weight next time, unless I fall within the specified range.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some of the complex movements are preceded by pre-exhaustion exercises.  This is to try and work as many muscles in as little time as possible, without over-exhausting any of the smaller ones.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When a pre-exhaustion exercise is used, there is no rest between the end of it, and the following exercise.  All other rests are &quot;&lt;em&gt;until I feel ready for the next exercise&lt;/em&gt;&quot; length rests, but no more than 5 mins.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Each workout will occur every 4 to 7 days.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If I&#39;m feeling creative, I may bung in some running specific plyometric exercises between sets too.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This should keep all workouts quite short and sweet and I should feel good, maybe even exhilarated, after with the feeling that I could do more.  The idea is not to tire myself out, just stress the muscles into adapting by increasing strength.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&#39;ll then be running on the other days of the week.  I&#39;m still experimenting with that I&#39;ll do on the running days, but will aim to put some sort of structure in place on that side of things soon. &lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Review: VivoBarefoot Aqua By Terra Plana</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/review-vivobarefoot-aqua-by-terra-plana\"/>\n   <updated>2009-10-26T11:04:52+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/review-vivobarefoot-aqua-by-terra-plana</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Aqua&quot; src=&quot;/assets/691987053_Lkjpf-200x210.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;210&quot; /&gt;In my quest to go completely barefoot, or as near as possible in as many environments as possible, I&#39;ve had my eye on replacing all my chunky shoes with more minimalist shoes. I&#39;ve had my eyes on a couple of brands, including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/vivobarefoot.php&quot;&gt;VivoBarefoot&lt;/a&gt; range from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com&quot;&gt;Terra Plana&lt;/a&gt;, but haven&#39;t really seen any in person to get an idea of what they&#39;re like.  I also wasn&#39;t too keen on blindly shelling out for a pair of shoes I&#39;d seen on the internet, have them imported from the US only to find they&#39;re hideous in person.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, luck was on my side as I was approached by a kind lady on behalf of Terra Plana and given the opportunity try a pair of shoes from their VivoBarefoot range.  After much umming and ahhing - &quot;Do I go for the casual looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/aqua-p-1040.html&quot;&gt;Aquas&lt;/a&gt; for everyday use, or the more formal looking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/dharma-p-1036.html?colour=143&quot;&gt;Dharmas&lt;/a&gt; for work use?&quot; - I opted for the Aquas, in white  (other colours are available), and placed my order.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Box&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later, a great big box arrived in the post.  I was only expecting a shoe-box sized box, but this was double the size.  I soon found out why... there were two pairs in the box: one in the size I&#39;d ordered (UK 10 / EU 44)  and one in the next size up (UK 11 / EU 45).  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those who like to see what comes in the box, here&#39;s a picture...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/691986894_eY5tE-500x500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Contents of a Terra Plana Aqua shoe box&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oooooo, aaaaaah &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;  For the greens out there - it&#39;s all recyclable too and actually encourages it on the back of the box...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/691986692_NwH9g-500x500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;We at Terra Plana hope that you will reuse this box. Here are five ideas: 1. Store your undies in it.&lt;br /&gt;\n2. Use it as a durable yet elegant gift box. 3. Bury your dead pet hamster in it. 4. Create a window box and grow mustard, cress and alfalfa sprouts. 5. Get snap happy and make a pinhole camera with it. To get more boxes to be re-used, order another pair of Terra Plana shoes at www.terraplana.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s at this point that I must point out that Terra Plana is probably the greenest shoe company on the planet, within their control&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/ethical_policy.php&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;.  Not only do they regularly re-evaluate what they can do to minimize waste and toxin use in their products, they try their hardest to make sure they use recycled materials and even make the box they sell the shoes in fully recyclable. Now how&#39;s that for green.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Fit&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Time for my fitting.  I have a very &quot;rigorous&quot; sizing test: I put them on, and then wonder around the house or sit in front of the computer until either it hurts, or I remember I need to try the other size.  First off the 10s: they fitted and were quite snug and comfy.  After about an hour I remembered I was testing the sizes and switched to the 11s.  What a difference. The 11s definitely felt bigger though I wasn&#39;t too sure if maybe they were a little too big.  No time for deliberating; this is a scientific test, so let the shoes speak for themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I soon completely forgot about the 11s on my feet.  They felt very comfortable, but I wasn&#39;t going to rule the 10s out just yet.  Time for a bit of side-by-side comparison: size 10 on one foot and size 11 on the other, and then switch. This final test was the clincher - definitely the 11s.  As I&#39;ve since read elsewhere, the VivoBarefoot shoes size a little on the small side and my experience confirms this.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Construction&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, Terra Plana are devoted to making sustainable and eco-friendly shoes, and we can see this in the construction of the Aquas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The VivoBarefoot Aquas are essentially made up of 3 parts:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The upper: this is a combination of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eleatherltd.com/&quot;&gt;E-Leather&lt;/a&gt; - a 75-80% recycled leather and synthetic fibre combination that looks and feels like real leather - and a synthetic mesh-like fabric made from recycled &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate&quot;&gt;polyethylene terephthalate&lt;/a&gt; (aka PET) panels.  This combination gives an attractive, light and flexible upper.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you recognise the acronym PET, that&#39;s because it&#39;s what coke bottles are made from.  It&#39;s also the stuff that is recycled to make fleeces, and now the fabric in the Aquas.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The inner: this is made up of several parts too.  The inner as a whole is soft with a little bit of cushioning around the entrance of the shoe with a sock-like inner liner that is the length of the tongue.  There is also a very thin foam removable inner sole.  As with the upper, the inner is made from recycled materials.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The sole: this is an &quot;&lt;em&gt;ultra-high abrasion and puncture resistant sole&lt;/em&gt;&quot; which is incredibly thin (3mm) and very flexible. Unfortunately, this part isn&#39;t made form recycled materials, but it is stitched onto the upper rather than being glued, so all is not lost on the green credentials here.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over-all the construction is very good and well thought out. Time will tell how durable they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Comfort&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been a big fan of Merrell shoes for years - so much so I bought the same model and colour 3 times in a row.  I found them incredibly comfortable and hard wearing.  Sadly, these guys now pale in comparison to the VivoBarefoot Aquas: these shoes are singularly the most comfortable shoes I&#39;ve ever worn.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The sock-like liner hugs the shoe onto the foot very comfortably so technically you don&#39;t need to fasten the laces to hold the shoe on, though tightening the laces does secure the shoe better. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The lack of heel, took a little getting used to at first.  When I first tried on the Aquas, I&#39;d just taken off my work shoes - a smart pair of black leather shoes - and instantly noticed the lack of a heel.  It felt like the front of my foot was raised higher than the heel, but this soon faded.  One significant thing I found with extended wear and time on my feet in the Aquas: I didn&#39;t experience the lower back pain I sometimes got when wearing the Merrells for extended periods of time.  This could be co-incidence, but I&#39;m inclined to believe it&#39;s the lack of heel, which in turn has resulted in an unnoticeable and slight improvement in posture as detailed in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/vivobarefoot_benefits.php&quot;&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; described by Terra Plana themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The thin soles and thin inner-sole really allow you to feel the ground below your feet too, and whilst you don&#39;t get as much feedback as you do from Vibram Five Fingers, you still get plenty.  The slight cushioning also makes heel striking, that is common with walking, a lot more comfortable and tolerable too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Look&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think everyone will like the look of the VivoBarefoot Aquas (my borther-in-law doesn&#39;t). They are quite a low profiled and wide shoe, but unlike the tyres on sports cars, society seems to think low profile (and minimalist when not slip-slops) shoes look weird.  The toe box is also wider than normal shoes, and whilst it&#39;s very comfortable, some people will associate the wider toe box with lower intelligence, a lack of class and even clowns (people come up with the strangest excuses).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I personally think the Aquas look great, and I really like the white ones.  I&#39;m not concerned with what people think of my shoes, or lack there of.  I&#39;m comfortable in the knowledge that I&#39;m doing the world of good for my body, and that&#39;s all that counts - I also had disproportionately large feet as a child so I soon learnt to ignore any comments about my feet. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The only downside I&#39;ve found with the Aquas is all my jeans are now too long.  I never realised just how much the heels on my Merrells were keeping my jeans off the floor, until I switched to the Aquas and found myself treading on the back of my trousers all the time.  To resolve this, I&#39;m bringing back the rolled up jeans look.  Watch out: it&#39;ll be all over the catwalks before you know it &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/691987244_fmbPV-200x133.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Aqua - Front&quot; /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/691987422_uGwZj-200x134.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Aqua - Side&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;The Summary&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have to admit I am very very impressed with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/aqua-p-1040.html&quot;&gt;VivoBarefoot Aquas&lt;/a&gt;.  They are incredibly comfortable, light, attractive, and even in the short period of time owning them, I&#39;m already noticing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/vivobarefoot_benefits.php&quot;&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt;.  I think the best way I can summarise wearing the Aquas is it&#39;s like wearing your slippers everywhere, but without the fear of the men in white coats coming to take you to a comfortably padded room.  I used to take off my shoes the moment I walked in the door, I don&#39;t when wearing the Aquas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These are singularly the most comfortable shoes I&#39;ve ever worn, and I&#39;ll be wearing them at every appropriate opportunity that isn&#39;t already taken by wearing my Vibrams or no shoes at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve deliberately not mentioned running in these.  I wouldn&#39;t advocate it.  The Aquas are definitely a casual shoe, and whilst you probably could run in them, I suspect you may soon find they&#39;re not the best for running.  All is not lost though, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/&quot;&gt;Terra Plana&lt;/a&gt; are bringing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/vivobarefoot-evo-running-shoes-sneak-peak&quot;&gt;VivoBarefoot Evo&lt;/a&gt; early next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One final tip: if you&#39;re buying these online without trying them on first, order one size larger than you usually wear.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">20km Per Week Goal: Done!</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/20km-per-week-goal-done\"/>\n   <updated>2009-10-25T07:53:12+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/20km-per-week-goal-done</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;As suspected &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/10km-in-a-week-barefoot-goal-ticked-off&quot;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, I didn&#39;t manage to get in the barefoot miles this week that I got in last week.  I did try once, but the route I took turned out to be a lot tougher on the feet than expected, especially the chestnut and other tree debris in the early and latter parts of the route.    The early morning cold doesn&#39;t make things any easier either, though my feet did warm up quite quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One plus side of last week is I felt fantastic after every run, so kept on running. As a result I quite happily ticked through 20km (over 22km in fact) without any complaints. Other than the 4.96km done barefoot, the rest were all done in my Vibrams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think next week I&#39;ll do a bit of out-and-back on the smoother sections of the routes round work to get more barefoot time in.  What will be interesting is seeing how I cope with the cold in the early mornings. The clocks have gone back today, so in theory it should be lighter and thus slightly warmer, though winter is fast approaching.  Who knows, I may have to move the barefoot runs to the afternoon.  We&#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">10km In a Week Barefoot Goal Ticked Off</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/10km-in-a-week-barefoot-goal-ticked-off\"/>\n   <updated>2009-10-16T16:36:49+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/10km-in-a-week-barefoot-goal-ticked-off</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, I&#39;m proud to say that today I ticked off the &quot;10km per week in training completely barefoot&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals&quot;&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; I set for myself, and I&#39;m quite proud of myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had a great week of barefoot running this thanks to some great autumnal weather and being on the early shift. Being on the early shift means I have to go for my runs later in the day, when it&#39;s warmer, from home rather than bright and early from work, when it&#39;s cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;On Monday, I set off on the out-and-back route I&#39;ve been using whenever I&#39;d been running barefoot before, but when I reached the turnaround point, I decided I wouldn&#39;t.  I decided to carry on all the way round the block (it&#39;s a 4.33km block) and I&#39;m glad I did.  The run was fantastic and my feet felt great.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then on Wednesday, I did the route in reverse.  Sadly, though I was a little over-eager and tried to go too fast.  As a result my form was a bit poor and I developed a few blisters on my toes which needed dealing with in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/dealing-with-blisters&quot;&gt;usual way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After Wednesday&#39;s exuberance, I&#39;d resigned to running today in my Vibrams, but when the time came to run I found that my blister-healing trick had worked brilliantly and my feet felt great.  So off I went and did the same course again, in the same direction as Monday, barefoot again.  And it was just a good as Monday&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, 3x 4.33km makes it a nice 12.99km in a week and I tick off one more goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll be able to do this sort of distance next week from work - some of the pavements round work are quite aggressive on the old feet, but we&#39;ll see.  I&#39;ll certainly get in at least 12km next week, though maybe not all barefoot.  The early morning cold is also likely to be a factor.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">VivoBarefoot Evo Running Shoes Sneak Peak</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vivobarefoot-evo-running-shoes-sneak-peak\"/>\n   <updated>2009-10-07T11:33:59+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vivobarefoot-evo-running-shoes-sneak-peak</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Looky looky what I received in my inbox from a kind lady at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.terraplana.com/&quot;&gt;Terra Plana&lt;/a&gt; (click for full size):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/photos/673118551_wiPwS-X2-1.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; src=&quot;/assets/673118551_wiPwS-L-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;VivoBarefoot Evo Press Release&quot; width=&quot;426&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;These look great and, whilst not as quirky or as outrageously different as the Vibram Five Fingers, I think the VVFs may be in for quite a challenge.

Just above it is a &quot;&lt;em&gt;rigid orthotic foundation that supports and protects your entire midfoot.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; which prevents &quot;&lt;em&gt;... over-stretching of the plantar ligaments across the base of the foot&lt;/em&gt;&quot; ... which in turn helps prevent &quot;&lt;em&gt;painful heel spurs and plantar fasciitis&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.  Erm, isn&#39;t the stretching part what feet are meant to do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Z-CoiL footwear is engineered specifically to relieve foot, leg and back pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Its patented, shock-absorbing design greatly reduces impact to the body and distributes pressure more evenly across the foot than conventional shoes do. And less impact means less pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;... and puts more cash in our pockets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, these shoes &quot;protect&quot; you by encompassing your feet in rigid blocks that don&#39;t move and adjust as your feet really should and then provides a spring to compensate for the lack of natural shock absorption and propulsion your feet naturally provide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh and they come in a wide range of fashionable designs too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please please please people, don&#39;t waste your money on these other than to maybe keep them in a glass cabinet along with your other bizarre collectors items.

This got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The method they use to analyse the gait and thus the &quot;need&quot; for orthotics is by using the pressure plate system like the GaitScan system.  For those not familiar with this method of analysis; essentially they put a rather advanced pressure mat onto the floor and then have you run over it, barefoot, aiming to land your foot squarely on the mat.  You then turn around and come back again and land on the mat with the other foot.  You may be asked to perform this a couple of times. Once done, a fancy colourful series of images is then presented onto the computer screen from which the agent can then analyse your gait.  If you&#39;ve never seen or experienced this system in action, pop down to your local Sweatshop, they&#39;ll be more than pleased to put it into action (and then sell you a pair of shoes &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, I&#39;ve been thinking about this method of gait &quot;analysis&quot; and I can&#39;t help but feel it&#39;s flawed in several significant ways which are never mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It only analyses one foot at a time.  Now whilst not a major issue, the fact that the foot plate is only big enough for one foot would mean people are more likely to adjust their stride and landing in order to ensure they land squarely on the mat.  What&#39;s more, people are likely to strike the ground with the foot landing on the mat harder than normal to ensure they really do hit it and they get a reading.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The test is always done indoors and in a relatively confined amount of space.  I can&#39;t comment on other people, but 10 - 20m of total distance is not enough for me to get into my full normal stride - the stride I&#39;m likely to be employing when I actually head out onto the road.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;And most importantly, you always perform the test barefoot.  It&#39;s essential the test is done barefoot so the computer can see how your foot is landing (assuming we ignore the above) and reacting and pushing off.  Now the problem with this comes in the fact that scientists have already proven that people run differently when wearing shoes, then when not.  A heel striker in shoes is not likely to be a heel striker barefoot.  The foot will also land more carefully when barefoot and the push-off won&#39;t be as hard.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not a doctor, and I admit I have experienced this method of gait analysis and bought a pair of shoes based off it&#39;s results in the past, but in retrospect I can&#39;t help feel it may be completely unnecessary (thankfully you don&#39;t have to pay for the analysis) and could potentially lead to more injuries as the analysis, in my eyes, is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So what&#39;s the alternative?  Well, barefoot or nearly barefoot running as nature intended all the time of course, but that&#39;s a very biased view.  If you really need to have gait analysis performed (I doubt you do unless you&#39;re a pro trying to eke out every bit of efficiency possible), then I believe the video method, on a treadmill, is a better system to use, though it too has it disadvantages, namely access and costs, and is likely to have it&#39;s own flaws too (I&#39;ve not been privileged enough to have one of these so I can&#39;t comment).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With what I know now about the benefits of running barefoot and the way the foot adjusts and strengthens to the new demands, I think people should toss the shoes for at least one session a week for a couple of months and then see if they really still need to get orthotics.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Tabata Time</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tabata-time\"/>\n   <updated>2009-09-09T10:05:08+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tabata-time</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m taking a bit of a break from running at the moment to let my lower legs repair and recover a bit.  I&#39;ve been going a bit &lt;abbr title=&quot;Yiddish for crazy&quot;&gt;mashuga&lt;/abbr&gt; recently and haven&#39;t really given my feet and legs a chance to recover properly.  As a result the little niggles one can expect from first starting running barefoot (or almost) are not clearing up completely between runs.  I don&#39;t want these to develop into full on injuries, so I&#39;m taking another enforced break from running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now I don&#39;t want to just stop exercising completely and sit on my arse, however I do still want to keep my cardio levels up and use this time to burn off as much fat as I can.  Moving to barefoot (or almost) has meant I&#39;ve had to keep my mileage quite low, so I don&#39;t really get a chance to burn much of my excess weight off.  I&#39;ve been putting in some time in the gym between runs, but it&#39;s not been enough - I&#39;ve noticed my weight creeping back up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m using this enforced break from running to try out this &quot;Tabata technique/protocol&quot; I&#39;ve read about in various places on the net.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;The Tabata protocol was devised by Dr. Izumi Tabata and his team at the National Institute of Fitness and Sports in Tokyo and is a 4 minute intense set made up of 8x 20 second maximum intensity intervals with 10 seconds rest between each interval.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started off with this and soon found just one 4 minute workout was no where near enough for me.  I hardly built up a sweat in those 4 minutes, so I&#39;ve extended it a bit further and devised the following training regime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; Do not jump straight into this workout.  This is what I do.  You may not be able to do this straight away, so start gently and slowly. You will hurt afterwards and I don&#39;t want to be responsible for hurting someone or for causing a heart attack.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday&lt;/strong&gt;: 30 minute tabata rowing intervals comprised of:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 mins slow and very gentle rowing&lt;/em&gt; (this is my warm up too)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;4 min tabata set&lt;/em&gt; (20 sec as fast as possible, 10 sec slow or stopped, repeat x8)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repeat the above 6 mins 5 times making a total of 30 mins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cool down and stretch&lt;/em&gt; (I don&#39;t time this as some days I cooldown quicker than others)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;: Full body tabata gym workout comprised of:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warm up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;3 sets of hanging pullups&lt;/em&gt;. I use good controlled form here and do as many reps as I can per set. I stop when I can&#39;t get my chin over the bar anymore.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 sets of 4 min tabata clean and press&lt;/em&gt; (20 sec of reps, 10 sec stopped, repeat x8) with a 2 min rest between each set. I don&#39;t do the olympic bum-to-floor style, I just life the barbell to my shoulders and then press it over my head.  That&#39;s one rep.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 sets of 4 min tabata machine chest press&lt;/em&gt; (20 sec of reps, 10 sec stopped, repeat x8). I use a machine here to be safe.  My arms and chest may get very very tired and I really don&#39;t fancy dropping a weight onto my face or chest.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 sets of 4 min alternating lunges&lt;/em&gt; (20 sec of reps, 10 sec stopped, repeat x8).  I hold a dumbell in each hands for these.  I use lifting straps too as my grip would give long before I&#39;m finished each set.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cool down and stretch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday&lt;/strong&gt;: Rest - I want to lose weight, not kill myself&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday&lt;/strong&gt;: 30 mins tabata cycling intervals as per the rowing intervals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;: Repeat Tuesday&#39;s workout.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday &amp; Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;: Rest&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve managed one week so far and boy is it tough, but I feel fantastic afterwards.  Each session burns in the region of 500-800kcal, depending on how much effort I put in and the weights etc involved and takes about 35-40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With lack of running and my commitment to weightlifting over the years my weight has fluctuated from the rather lean 64kg I was when running as an 19 year to the mighty 98kg I weighed in the peak of my weightlifting phase. I now sit slightly towards the top end of this range at 89kg. I know I&#39;ll never get back to 64kg, and quite frankly really don&#39;t want to be that skinny again, but I do think I could get down to a more reasonable 75-85kg.   This enforced break, coupled with the fact I&#39;m not drinking much beer at the moment (my wife and I are expecting our first child, so I&#39;m being supportive by cutting back on the amount of beer I drink) and this pretty intense exercise regime, should help me towards that goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll keep you all updated.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Barefootrunner.co.uk: Code Update</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefootrunnercouk-code-update\"/>\n   <updated>2009-09-01T16:22:00+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/barefootrunnercouk-code-update</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note to say I&#39;ve just updated the backend code to this site.

Take note of his times: 9.58 sec and 19.19 sec respectively.  Notice something extra-ordinary?  His 200m is only a fraction more than double his 100m time.  I&#39;d say once he&#39;s going, he&#39;s pretty much going at a constant speed for at least 160m of his 200m (assuming it takes him 40m to get up to speed).  Imagine his times if he could take a running start to both races or even if he could keep this going for a full 400m.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Actually, come to think of it, if we did a very crude and overly simplified calculation we can probably guess what he&#39;s capable of over 400m:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First some assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He starts all events at the same speed and takes 40m to reach top speed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He maintains a constant speed (neigh on impossible, but we&#39;re looking at an ideal situation) for 360m of his 400m race&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He only slows by 3 5 1/100ths of a second for every successive 100m&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This would give him a time of 38:41 sec.  He&#39;d smash Michael Johnson&#39;s  world record (43.18 sec) by nearly 5 seconds. He&#39;d beat it even if we assumed he&#39;d lose a whole second per 100m.  Now that&#39;s impressive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll be moving up to the 400m any time soon, nor do I think he&#39;d actually be able to attain such a time - he is a man after all, not a machine, but I&#39;m certainly looking forward to his future races.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">New VVF Alternative Coming From Terra Plana</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vvf-alternative-coming-from-terra-plana\"/>\n   <updated>2009-08-22T09:22:03+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vvf-alternative-coming-from-terra-plana</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Check out what&#39;s been spotted on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitpic.com/elqiu&quot;&gt;interweb&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;New Terra Plana minimalist shoes&quot; src=&quot;/assets/NewTerraPlana.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A new pair of minimalist shoes to compete with Vibram Five Fingers.

I tried my hardest NOT to wear any shoes whenever possible and succeeded. In fact, today is the first day in 16 days in which I&#39;ve had to put on a pair of shoes and socks (for work) and I must say I can&#39;t wait to get them off.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I spent most of the time barefoot whilst milling around the campsites and driving.  I wore my Vibrams when out and about sight seeing (because barefoot isn&#39;t always appropriate) and cycling and I wore my cheap aging flipflops when the grass outside the tent was wet - my wife would go nuts if I even contemplated walking into the tent with muddy or wet feet/Vibrams &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/photos/621132537_uf7fE-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/621132537_uf7fE-499x287.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hanging Above Lac d&#39;Annecy&quot; title=&quot;Hanging Above Lac d&#39;Annecy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/photos/621132508_Xcigo-XL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/621132508_Xcigo-Th.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vibrams on hang glider launch ramp&quot; title=&quot;Vibrams on hang glider launch ramp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/photos/621133454_jjehG-XL-1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/621133454_jjehG-Th-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Barefoot at Champagne Colin&quot; title=&quot;Barefoot at Champagne Colin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://colinseymour.smugmug.com/photos/621127420_bqvrf-XL-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/621127420_bqvrf-Th-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Vibrams at the port at Bout-du-Lac&quot; title=&quot;Vibrams at the port at Bout-du-Lac&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all it was fantastic, and great fun to see the looks on people&#39;s faces as I wondered around barefoot or in my Vibrams.

Not the normal shoe and sock rubbing against flesh type, but rather the flesh rubbing against tar/dirt type.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the moment, my current barefoot mileage is in the region of 10km a week, on paving/tar, broken up into 3 sessions of just over 3km each.  This is just long enough for me to enjoy the freedom of running barefoot and feel when I&#39;m doing things wrong.  This is also long enough to acclimatise my feet to the rougher compounds with only a minimal amount of damage on each run.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, sometimes I&#39;m a little over-eager or tired and I either run too far, too fast, or with appalling form (ie too much toeing-off) and as a result I end up with a blister on one of my toes - normally the one just next to the little toe for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my blister treatment follows, but first a warning:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;What you are about to read is not for the faint hearted or the overly protective or sensitive types who want to drench things in anti-bac spray and then wrap in cotton wool to keep them safe and sound.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re a barefoot runner, or interested in running barefoot (hence you&#39;re reading this) this isn&#39;t likely to be you, but it may just be your other half/mother/GP etc, so best not perform this in front of them or let them know about this.  I know my wife gets very squeamish so I have to do this when she&#39;s not about.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Right, now we&#39;ve got that out of the way, we can get down to the nitty gritty...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wash your foot with warm soapy water.  You don&#39;t need to get all fancy with soaks or anti-bacterial or antiseptic soaps, just good ol&#39; plain soap will do the trick&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hobble (you don&#39;t want to make your foot dirty) over to your wife&#39;s/mother&#39;s/grandma&#39;s/your sewing kit and take out a thin sewing needle&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sterilize the needle by either heating it up with a candle/lighter or dipping it in antiseptic liquid.  I don&#39;t worry too much about this and just hold the needle in my mouth whilst I perform the next step.  Sssh, don&#39;t tell my wife or my mum, they&#39;ll both have a heart-attack at my sterilization techniques&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cut a length of cotton - any colour will do, but some say white is best.  I quite like red &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt;.  The length isn&#39;t too important either, it just needs to be long enough for a little bit of threading&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thread your now sterilized needle and arm yourself - we&#39;re going in...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Locate your blister and slide your threaded needle right through the length of it until it comes out the other side.  Be sure to leave the thread going through the blister with a length protruding on either side.  This will be the wick used to drain all the moisture out.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mop up any liquid that may have seeped out and gently press down on your blister to help drain it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Trim the length of thread, if you need to.  About 1cm either side of the blister should be plenty.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it.  You&#39;re done.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Things will be a little sensitive for the first few hours, but you&#39;ll soon forget about it. Within a couple of days, you should find your blister will have healed, without any loss of skin and the thread will have worked it&#39;s way out all by itself. You may even find you can run on it within 24 hours, so your training shouldn&#39;t be affected too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m really not sure where I first heard this, but ever since trying it many many years ago as a kid, I&#39;ve stuck with it.  I don&#39;t know of a more effective and quicker treatment for blisters.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Athletic Footwear and Running Injuries</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/athletic-footwear-and-running-injuries-1\"/>\n   <updated>2009-07-22T14:10:04+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/athletic-footwear-and-running-injuries-1</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I think this is one of the best articles I&#39;ve read that details the harmful effects of modern running shoes: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quickswood.com/my_weblog/2006/08/athletic_footwe.html&quot;&gt;Athletic Footwear and Running Injuries&lt;/a&gt;.

They absolutely stank and a lovely cheesy smell followed me whenever I wore them, and even after I&#39;d taken them off and washed my feet (it wasn&#39;t me, I promise).  Sadly washing them normally (ie in the washing machine) and allowing to dry completely didn&#39;t completely relieve them of their smell and they were soon creating a fugg around me again within a run or two. As you can image, the Mrs was not happy at all - &quot;&lt;em&gt;he normally smells so nice&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Thankfully all was not lost.  A simple soak over night in a bucket of warm water with about a cup of white spirit vinegar soon cleared the smell.  They now have a weak vinegary smell, despite a thorough rinsing, but this is no where near as bad as the stench they used to have. People also can&#39;t smell the vinegar from across the room and the wife is happy too &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt;   The smell of vinegar should wear off relatively quickly, and should hopefully extend the time until the next vinegar bath. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From my quick research, it appears this is quite a common complaint with the topic popping up on numerous forums, though none of the complaints are quite as amusing as this rendition I found by &lt;a href=&quot;http://patrickhdonnelly.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Patrick Donnelly&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://board.crossfit.com/showthread.php?t=37021&quot;&gt;Crossfit forum&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibram Inc.,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been an owner of a pair of FiveFinger Sprints for over a year now, and have slowly grown accustomed to using them for everyday life. In fact, about three weeks ago when I moved to college, I began using them as nearly my only footwear. There&#39;s one problem with that: they stink.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They don&#39;t just smell, they stink. They omit a foul stench that stalks me throughout the day; an odor so pungent that it surpasses anything any of my senses have ever sensed; a fetor so abrasive to the nostrils that a mere sniff of it could drive a man mad. It&#39;s rather unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The smell began after two days of rain, where I, riding my bike around campus to get from place to place, had gotten my Vibrams thoroughly soaked. Luckily, there&#39;s not much fabric to them, so they dried quickly. After noticing the smell, I washed them, which caused the smell to subside. A week and a half later, the smell had recollected its forces and began to hurl further barrages of odors. Naturally, I washed them again - once again, the smell retreated. Yet, it still was not vanquished. Now the smell is back again, with a vengeance, stronger than ever, dead set on wreaking havoc upon everything in its path! It must be stopped once and for all!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, yeah. It&#39;s stinking up the whole dorm room and even leaking into the halls. How do I fix this for good? I know that when you&#39;re completely barefoot, your feet don&#39;t acquire a smell because it&#39;s difficult for the bacteria to grow when all the sweat evaporates so quickly. The Vibrams seem to be a refugee camp for those exiled bacteria. I can&#39;t simply keep washing them, since not only do I lack the laundry to warrant the washes, but I lack the quarters to fund them. That&#39;s completely ignoring the fact that the smell is recurring with each wash, and getting stronger each time too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated by myself and by my roommate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Take care,&lt;br /&gt;\nPatrick Donnelly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no indication if a response was actually received, but there are a lot of other good suggestions for cleaning and keeping your Vibram Five Fingers smelling clean and fresh in the post.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Show Off Your Vibrams</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/show-off-your-vibrams\"/>\n   <updated>2009-07-10T16:43:45+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/show-off-your-vibrams</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve just recently stumbled upon a great site dedicated to the world of &quot;&lt;em&gt;feet as they were designed to be—unshod and free&lt;/em&gt;&quot; with a big dedication to Vibram Five Fingers - &lt;a href=&quot;http://birthdayshoes.com/&quot;&gt;birthdayshoes.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re feeling apprehensive about going out in your Vibrams (you shouldn&#39;t be: I wear mine all the time when I&#39;m not at work or barefoot and have only had 1 comment, from a toddler of all people), take a squizz through this site and see all the pictures people have submitted of them in their &lt;acronym title=&quot;Vibram Five Fingers&quot;&gt;VFF&lt;/acronym&gt;.

By shoes, I mean those heavy, expensive things with huge wadges of foam and rubber and laces - not Vibrams or other minimalistic &quot;foot protectors&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The reason is plain and simple: it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Now for a bit of background into this decision.  Monday was a bank holiday here in the UK.  It started off a bit dull and grey, but the sun soon prevailed and it turned into a glorious day, so the wife and I went out for a nice long walk in the sunshine around some nearby lakes.  I&#39;ve been wearing my Vibrams more and more recently, not just for running, but also for things like cycling into and walking around town, and I thought I&#39;d wear them for our long stroll.  Brilliant idea.  As expected, it felt great and no complaints after over 3 hours of continuous walking on tar, gravel and grass.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As can be expected in the UK (we measure summer by hours, not months), the next morning was grey and very wet.  Instead of a run, I thought I&#39;d hit the rower for a bit of indoor fitness.  This only lasted 13 minutes as the fire alarm went off.  I was a bit naughty here: instead of dropping everything and getting out of the building to stand in the peeing rain whilst someone walked into the kitchen to confirm that the catering staff had forgotten to turn off the smoke alarms over the cooker, I snuck into the change rooms, grabbed by ID badge and took a run round the office block - in my trainers.  Hey, if I&#39;m going to be in the rain, I may as well take advantage of the time and do something useful &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:smile:&#39; alt=&#39;😄&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f604.svg&#39;&gt; . Bad idea - the shoe part that is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t actively try and run any differently than usual.  I just ran and quite enjoyed the short run too.  No problems during the run, but as the day wore on, the pains started to appear.  The inner lower part of my shins started to feel very tender - almost bruised.  I haven&#39;t had this feeling in a very very long time and I can only put that down to not running in shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, things felt much better on Wednesday morning and Wednesday&#39;s run in Vibrams was good and the day ended without any niggles what-so-ever.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now this isn&#39;t a scientific study, but a very simple personal test that quickly showed that running in shoes unintentionally changes my running style and to the detriment of my body.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s it.  No more running in shoes for me.  It&#39;s barefoot, Vibrams (or similar) or no run from now on.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Tim Ferris Discovers Vibram Five Fingers</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tim-ferris-discovers-vibram-five-fingers\"/>\n   <updated>2009-05-09T11:48:27+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/tim-ferris-discovers-vibram-five-fingers</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Tim Ferris, the author of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/4-hour-Work-Week-Escape-Anywhere/dp/0091923727/?tag=costest-21&quot;&gt;The 4-hour Work Week&lt;/a&gt; and a very popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; has just discovered the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/05/07/vibram-five-fingers-shoes/&quot;&gt;virtues of Vibram Five Fingers&lt;/a&gt;.

He advises walking barefoot for a few weeks to toughen up the skin on the bottom of the foot as well as the muscles in the ankles and feet. Once you are ready to run, start with a mere five minutes, increasing slowly and running barefoot every couple of days. From there, build to up to 20 minutes over a month. After a few weeks of this, the feet and ankles will be stronger, thus reducing the risk of injury. Possible places to train include sandy beaches and golf courses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The barefoot running technique has been described as falling forward. It has also been described as gently kissing the ground with the balls of your feet. If you need one more concept to meditate on while running barefoot, imagine that a log is lying across the path in front of you; you don’t want to kick the front of the log with your toes. You want to step over the log with each step, keeping your knee bent and placing the ball of your foot immediately behind the log as your chest moves over the top of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The article is a good read and provides some useful information and answers some questions people have about the thought of running barefoot  My favourite question answered is...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What do you use for arch support?” some might ask. “My arch,” is probably usually the first answer that pops out of the mouth of die-hard barefooters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Damn right.  That&#39;s what it&#39;s there for &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:grinning:&#39; alt=&#39;😀&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f600.svg&#39;&gt; .  Time for another barefoot run for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you think you get strange looks running with Vibrams, you should see the looks you get when running completely &lt;acronym title=&quot;barefoot in my native Sefrican&quot;&gt;kaalvoet&lt;/acronym&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Starting Running Barefoot From Scratch</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/starting-running-barefoot-from-scratch\"/>\n   <updated>2009-04-28T10:25:53+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/starting-running-barefoot-from-scratch</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I received a &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-completely-barefoot-run#comment-41&quot;&gt;great question&lt;/a&gt; in the comments on my post about my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/first-completely-barefoot-run&quot;&gt;first completely barefoot run&lt;/a&gt;, and rather than reply in the comments where it may be hidden from others, I thought I&#39;d reply via a post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The question is...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys - never really been into running but have been thinking about getting into some serious running! Have seen quite a number of links and websites about barefoot running, and given that I&#39;m barefoot a lot during the summer I&#39;m wondering whether I should go straight for Vibram/barefoot running rather than learning and then un-learning with running shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What advice would you guys give?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First off, welcome to the world of running, and it&#39;s great to hear your considering barefoot running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My advice would be to start running barefoot from the very beginning.  As you&#39;re not a runner now, you won&#39;t have any bad habits, expensive shoes or any anxiety about getting back to previous fitness levels and speeds, so the only thing really holding you back is your body.  And that&#39;s the important part as it&#39;s going to be your biggest limiting factor at first and if you&#39;re not careful, it will be the part that will scare you away from running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;By starting running completely barefoot from the beginning, you have no choice but to take it slowly and gently - your feet won&#39;t allow you to over-do it. Over time you&#39;ll find you can run further and further and find each successive run more comfortable and enjoyable.  This slow progressive increase in distance and time will help your body adapt to the new rigors of running and should significantly reduce the chances of getting any injuries, and hopefully completely prevent them.  You&#39;ll also be ensuring you run with good form as you&#39;ll soon find out if your form is bad as it&#39;ll hurt straight away - your feet will let you know the moment you land, rather than letting your bones or muscles tell you days, weeks or even months later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As you&#39;re starting from scratch, start with some short barefoot walks on grass - you may not need to worry about this too much as you already spend a fair amount of time barefoot already.  As you become more comfortable with this, pick things up to a gentle jog every now and then. For example mix 5 mins of walking with 30 sec of jogging and then decrease the walking times and increase the jogging times as your fitness improves and your feet strengthen, but be sure to stop as soon as your feet start to feel tender or anything else starts to feel a bit uncomfortable.  Once you&#39;re comfortable with running on the grass, start introducing some barefoot walking on smooth pavements and roads.  Once the road/pavement walks become comfortable you can start throwing in the odd jog and do the same thing with the hard stuff as you did with the grass.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll probably have a bit of muscle soreness in the first few weeks, but this is par for the course when taking on any form of exercise, however this should only be muscle soreness and should subside after a couple of days and you&#39;ll soon be running without any muscle soreness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Essentially, you want to take things carefully and slowly.  You may find your fitness levels will improve quicker than your feet can strengthen, so always listen to your feet.  This is what I believe is one of the motivating factors for running barefoot: by not wearing shoes, your feet will tell you when you&#39;re doing something wrong straight away and you can correct instantly and prevent an injury.  It&#39;s like touching something hot - your fingers tell you straight away and you react so you don&#39;t burn yourself.  The same thing happens with your feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to get some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/&quot;&gt;Vibrams&lt;/a&gt;, then by all means, but save it until you&#39;re running regularly without any discomfort at the time or after running.  Then limit their use for longer runs and offroad/trail running when you&#39;re likely to encounter more stones or more &quot;wear-and-tear&quot;.  They don&#39;t block out the sensation of trodding on stones, however they do make it more tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this answers your question and I hope you enjoy running barefoot.  Despite the strange looks, it&#39;s well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">The Painful Truth About Trainers</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/the-painful-truth-about-trainers\"/>\n   <updated>2009-04-21T14:45:54+01:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/the-painful-truth-about-trainers</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a great article on the Daily Mail site about running barefoot: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1170253/The-painful-truth-trainers-Are-expensive-running-shoes-waste-money.html&quot;&gt;The painful truth about trainers: Are running shoes a waste of money?&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#39;m slowly building up the &quot;time on my feet&quot; to get my body and feet used to running.  This is mainly an injury prevention measure. I&#39;m also trying to stick to the old adage that you shouldn&#39;t increase your mileage by more than 10% a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the moment I&#39;m up to 2x 18-20 min gentle runs a week with one in Vibrams and one in shoes, and 2-3 weights sessions in the gym broken up into upper body and lower body workouts (this is actually a major cut in the amount of gym work I used to do so is also taking a fair amount of getting used to).  The runs have been going really well and I&#39;ve not felt the slightest bit of pain or discomfort in either my feet or calves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That is until I tried something different on Monday.  Foolishly, I thought I might see if I can start throwing some speed work in to the mix and to get things going, thought I&#39;d determine my Billat pace (aka vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;) (mistake 1), in my Vibrams (mistake 2).  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I took a leisurely jog down to a nearby park which has a path around it that is about a mile long (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mapmyrun.com/run/united-kingdom/reading/479660363&quot;&gt;mapmyrun.com route&lt;/a&gt;) with 100m markers all the way round.  As is needed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brianmac.co.uk/vvo2max.htm&quot;&gt;calculating&lt;/a&gt; your Billat pace (I first mentioned it in the context of &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/billat-pace-rowing&quot;&gt;rowing before&lt;/a&gt;), I blasted my way round and managed to cover about 1570m in my six minutes (for those that are interested, that makes my Billat pace about &lt;acronym title=&quot;6 / 0.975552772mls = 6.150359234 min/ml = 6:09/mile&quot;&gt;6:09/mile&lt;/acronym&gt; or &lt;acronym title=&quot;6 / (1570m/1000m) = 3.821656051 min/km = 3:49/km&quot;&gt;3:49/km&lt;/acronym&gt;).  I stuck to the grass verge and actually really enjoyed running fast again, but sadly my legs and feet weren&#39;t too happy the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The muscles in my feet are feeling very tired and my calves very stiff.  Based on this, I&#39;d say my form goes to pot when I run fast (need more practice &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; ) and I really need to concentrate on building my base a bit more, so no more grease-lightening runs for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, the gently-gently approach is working very well and I&#39;m getting in a good mix of shod and Vibram-ed runs and will continue building up a good solid base before diving back into speed work.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Arctic Shower</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/arctic-shower\"/>\n   <updated>2009-03-13T09:01:08+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/arctic-shower</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Ah, there&#39;s nothing like an arctic shower to start your day.

Only a short 10 minute stint today in shoes, but I&#39;m feeling good and my feet are feeling good.  Hopefully it&#39;ll be plain sailing from now on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My plan for this week is to give my feet a chance to adjust to the joys of running again, in shoes, and get back into the Vibrams next week.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Vibram Running Experiences So Far</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vibram-running-experiences-so-far\"/>\n   <updated>2009-01-07T16:48:15+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/vibram-running-experiences-so-far</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I received a great comment on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/billat-pace-rowing&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; that I thought deserves a post of it&#39;s own in response.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jason&#39;s comment was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;\nWhat a great find regards V Billat. Some good stuff on that pponline site. Have read other V02 stuff on there but that was another level. Have been following your blog as I am experimenting with vibrams myself. Like all other blogs I have read, sore/stiff calf muscles are a right of passage as muscles that have been dormant re-awake. My own observation has been the distinct lack of joint pain following a run. Only doing 2 - 3 miles at a time. But when I go back to shoes my knees suffer for 3 - 4 days after.&lt;br /&gt;\n1 question if I may. On your runs in the vibrams, how did your pace compare to running in shoes?&lt;br /&gt;\nI ask as I seem to be clocking = or better than in shoes. I did not expect this or at least not yet.\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;First off, it&#39;s great hear there&#39;s someone else trying to run in the Vibrams, but more importantly, great news about the lack of joint pain after running in them.  Sounds like nature may be telling you something there Jason.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The question itself is why I thought it best to provide a post of it&#39;s own.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;I&#39;ve not had a chance to do much in the way of distance as I was silly enough to switch to the Vibrams full time whilst I still had the remnants of an old injury, but for those runs I did get in, I found my Vibram times were mostly quicker than my shoe runs and with less effort too.  I believe it&#39;s the way they encourage you to run, rather than the lack of weight, that is responsible for this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve found running in the the Vibrams seems to encourage a lighter and more fluid running style. I&#39;m a forefoot striker so never really thought my running style was being affected by the braking effect commonly seen with heel striking, but switching to the Vibrams soon let me know I was experiencing some sort of braking effect (which may explain the shin splints and knee injuries I used to get in shoes) - running in my usual style just didn&#39;t feel 100% right - it felt quite jarring, so I had to adapt. It was this jarring and need for change that made me look into my running style and is what got me onto the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.posetech.com/&quot;&gt;POSE technique&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Running in the Vibrams provides instant feedback via your feet and you soon learn to adapt.  I think it&#39;s this adaption that leads to more efficient and graceful running, which in turn leads to the quicker times with less effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aaaahhhh... all this talk of running is killing me.  I&#39;m so eager to get running again, but I have to be patient: I want to be 100% sure all injuries have healed - I don&#39;t want to be stuck on this rower any longer than I need to be. The rower does have one advantage though: it&#39;s a great opportunity to shed the Christmas weight &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re running barefoot, or in Vibrams, let me know your experiences.

Well, simple really: as you&#39;ll recall from my previous post, I&#39;m not running at the moment and am using rowing to keep fit instead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This month&#39;s  UK edition of Runner&#39;s World (January &#39;09) has an article on a method of training devised by Veronique Billat.  The basic principle is you determine your vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; max and then train at that level using varying intervals.  I&#39;m a big fan of intervals (I know, I&#39;m insane) and was quite eager to try this out however due to my self-imposed running &quot;embargo&quot;, this is currently off the cards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fear not, I turned to my good friend - t&#39;Internet - to see if I could find details on using this approach for rowing.  Well, the best source of info I could find was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/0350.htm&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; which provides quite generic instructions, but doesn&#39;t explicitly mention rowing, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brianmac.co.uk/vvo2max.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which provides a bit more info and a handy calculator.  As the instructions are quite generic, I couldn&#39;t see any reason why it shouldn&#39;t be possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve decided to see if I could apply the principles to rowing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Yesterday I did about 10 mins of gentle rowing and then blasted my way through 6 mins of hard fast rowing to see how far I could get in that time - 1598m.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now to calculate my vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; max:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n   Distance / seconds \r\n=  1598 / 360\r\n=  4.44 metres / second\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t particularly useful when it comes to rowing as the rowing machines I have access to show pace in time per 500m, so  converting this to time per 500m should make things easier...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n  6/((Distance/1000m)*2)\r\n= 1:53 mins / 500m\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So in order to row at my vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; max pace, I need to be rowing at a pace of 1min 53 secs per 500m.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My next challenge was to determine my tvVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; max.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With my vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; max pace, I set to determining my tvVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; max this morning. I should probably have left it a couple more days, but I was too anxious to get going.  My tvVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; max came in at 1890m.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, a few technical bits that are worth considering in the context of this post:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;all rowing is done with a drag setting of about 130&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I was very honest with myself when calculating my vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; and tvVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; settings:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;: I used the timer to ensure I could get an accurate distance for 6 mins.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;tvVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;: I allowed for a fluctuation of 3 seconds per 500m in either direction on my vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; pace as keeping a consistent pace is a bit hard.  I took my distance reading as soon as I hit 3 consecutive strokes that were 3 or more seconds above my vVO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; pace.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now I have my figures, I can go about training using Billat pace on the rower.  I&#39;ll keep you updated as I progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Goals on Hold For The Moment</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals-on-hold-for-the-moment\"/>\n   <updated>2008-12-01T16:57:56+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals-on-hold-for-the-moment</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I&#39;ve had to put my goal hunting on hold for the moment.  I really didn&#39;t want to have to do this, but if I&#39;m going to succeed in moving whole-heartedly across to barefoot/Vibram clad running, I have to be sensible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals&quot;&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt; list, you&#39;ll see I&#39;ve started off with two very simple and easy to attain goals:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1km training run, 3x a week without feeling stiff or sore on the days that follow.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2km training run, 3x a week without feeling stiff or sore on the days that follow.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I&#39;ve conquered both of these goals in distance, but not without the latter part - &quot;without feeling stiff or sore on the days that follow&quot; - I&#39;m being very strict with myself here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The stiffness is no longer an issue, it&#39;s the pain in my feet.  The pain in my 2nd metatarsal I &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/last-weeks-runs&quot;&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt; keeps cropping up as soon as I start to increase my distances.  I suspect I may have a slight stress fracture left from my first over-ambitious attempts at running barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So in the interests of injury cure and prevention, I&#39;m taking the next two months off running completely.  No running barefoot, Vibram clad or in shoes.  I&#39;ll be turning to the indoor rower to keep my cardio fitness up in the mean time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I think the take home message here is: a little at a time.  This potential injury is due to me taking things too fast, too soon when I first got the idea of barefoot running in my head.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s affecting my calculated approach, which this blog is documenting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully by the end of January my feet will be happy and I can make a concerted effort with running barefoot again.&lt;/p&gt;\n</content>\n </entry>\n \n <entry>\n   <title type=\"html\">Now I Have Some Goals</title>\n   <link href=\"https://barefootrunner.co.uk/now-i-have-some-goals\"/>\n   <updated>2008-11-14T18:54:16+00:00</updated>\n   <id>https://barefootrunner.co.uk/now-i-have-some-goals</id>\n   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve put together a table of &lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.co.uk/goals/&quot;&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt; I plan to achieve in my quest to be a barefoot runner.

The feeling of freedom far out weighs the metrics.  Anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mapmyrun.com&quot;&gt;mapmyrun.com&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of measuring the distance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s run: about 2.92km in 13:43 which works out at about 4:41/km.

This is my little challenge to see if I can go from running in shoes to running the way nature intended: BAREFOOT.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now this isn&#39;t just a whim, it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been considering quite seriously for quite some time and I&#39;m set to begin my journey on...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 2em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Monday 13 October 2008&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;Just a little short of 10 years ago, I moved over to the UK from South Africa to see how life in Europe is.  It was essentially a new start for me.  At the time, I was running a lot in South Africa, and actually ran my last 10k road race the week before I flew out.  That was the last time I officially ran a race.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On arriving in the UK, the whole prospect of finding a place to live, a job and generally settling in took priority, and as a result, running took a backseat.  Actually, backseat is the wrong word: it was left out of my life entirely.  I did try keeping up the running, but no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn&#39;t get myself to run with any sort of regularity with the weather being the biggest deterrent.  Instead I opted for joining the gym, only after a few too many beers and far too much food &lt;img class=&#39;emoji&#39; draggable=&#39;false&#39; title=&#39;:wink:&#39; alt=&#39;😉&#39; src=&#39;https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/svg/1f609.svg&#39;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Joining gym had the right effect and soon I was losing fat and gaining muscle, and lots of it. As part of my gym program I tried to get back into running again, and well, let me just say running on a treadmill has got to be the most boring form of running in the world.  On sunny days I ventured out into the woods or on the road, but my aspirations were short lived: I went too far, too fast and too soon and ended up injured. Time and time again I tried getting back into running, and each time I spent more on running shoes and still ended up injured.  My heart could take the challenge, just my knees and bones couldn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I then turned to correcting my running style, after all I&#39;m a lot heavier now and &quot;fixing&quot; the shoes wasn&#39;t having any effect and that&#39;s when I discovered the POSE method and so far, I&#39;ve been pretty injury free since I started using this method of running.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also now got myself a pair of Vibram Five Fingers and absolutely love the natural feel of running in them.  This is pretty much where my desire to move to running barefoot has come from, and the thought that thousands of African runners can&#39;t be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, I&#39;ve set myself the goal of moving from running in shoes to running barefoot and running my first 10K race in the UK barefoot.  My current goal is for the middle of summer 2009 and I hope to document my progress and training as I go along.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the moment things are hectic at work and home as I prepare to go away on my honeymoon, but things are all set to get going when I return.
