Good. Lets carry on...\n\nAs you may or may not be know, [Halp is now in maintenance mode](https://github.com/github/halp/issues/3653), and we're looking at our options.  One option is to find a replacement tool that both .com support and Enterprise support can use, and probably all the other teams that deal with a group inbox for communicating with our customers.\n\nIf you were at Summit, you'll know this, but for those who weren't, I'm the :person_with_blond_hair: representing the Enterprise Support team on [this project](https://ghe.io/support-ops/ideas/issues/5) and I'm using this issue to gather more information about our requirements, usage scenarios and products we can test.\n\nSo without further ado, this is what I've come up with so far...\n\n## Enterprise Support Ticket System Requirements\n\n### Absolutely must haves:\n\n- 24/7 availability\n- In and outbound email support.\n- Google Apps email integration as that's what we use for our email.\n\n- Engineer email notifications:\n  - New ticket - to all.\n  - Updated ticket - to owner or all if unassigned.\n  - Closure - to owner.\n\n- Customer email notifications:\n  - Automatic confirmation of receipt of initial email.\n  - Notification of a pending ticket awaiting their response.\n  - Notification of closure of a ticket\n    -  The messages in these notifications should be customisable.\n\n- Internal engineer web interface in which we can:\n  - See a centralised queue/dashboard view for each team.\n  - Clearly distinguish all new, assigned and unassigned tickets.\n  - Accept tickets.\n  - Assign tickets to other groups or engineers.\n  - Respond to tickets.\n  - Change the status and priority of tickets.\n  - Merge and mark tickets as duplicates.\n  - Delete and mark tickets as spam.\n  - Close tickets.\n  - Private and public notes.\n  - Search through current and old tickets.\n  - Set multiple ticket states, eg triage, open, pending, resolved, closed as we have with Zendesk.\n  - Reference other tickets by ID, eg `#12345` as Zendesk allows.\n\n- Customer web interface in which they can:\n  - Open new tickets.\n  - View their current and previous tickets.\n  - See all interactions between them and GitHub in a single view of the ticket.\n  - Reply to current tickets.\n  - Mark tickets as urgent.\n  - Close or mark tickets as resolved.\n  - Reference other tickets by ID, eg `#12345` as Zendesk allows.\n  - Add additional recipients for responses, eg add CCs.\n\n- Indefinite retention of closed tickets.\n- Ability to interact with PagerDuty.\n- API for Hubot to update tickets - for things like the arrival of bundles.\n- Automatic ticket resolution after a period of time (currently 14 days when in pending with no response).\n- Automatic ticket closure after a period of time (currently 14 days).\n- Support for reasonably sized attachments.  20MB currently offered by Zendesk is probably sufficient.\n- A ticket ID.\n- Automatic handling of spam, out of office replies and automatic responses.\n\n\n### Nice to haves:\n\n- Markdown to format outbound emails.\n- Markdown on inbound customer emails.\n- Web interface allowing submitting of tickets without signing in.  I've put this as a nice-to-have as it's a convenience but not an absolute requirement in my mind.  This will also stem spam a bit.\n- Canned responses.\n- 5 min delay as Halp has (Zendesk never had this but we wish it did).\n- Editable notes (edit content and privacy).\n- An “on-hold” or other status for tickets that can’t be closed but don’t need to remain open.\n- Pinned internal comment that floats to the top.  Good for tracking current status and train of thought.\n- @mentions with notification.\n- Mobile apps for iOS and Android.\n- The ability to adjust the status of current tickets via email like [Zendesk offers](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203691006-Updating-ticket-properties-from-your-inbox) - who knew this? :smile: Additionally, it would be great if we could expose the `#status solved` from :point_up: option to customers too.\n- Ability for customers to change priority of ticket themselves and for this to trigger an event on PagerDuty.\n- Customisable rejection message that is sent to customers when they send an email with a large attachment.  This would be useful to automatically say \"Thanks for your email, but it contain an attachment that was too large. Your email has been accepted, but please upload the attachment to https://enterprise.github.com/support/bundles/new?ticket=[ID]\"\n\n## Ticket workflow scenarios:\n\nI'll flesh these out into full unabridged checklist scenarios when it comes to testing and once I've received feedback from everyone.\n\n#### Scenario 1: Customer logs a normal priority ticket via email\n\nThis tests the current behaviour customers use when emailing enterprise@github.com.  The customer only uses email and the engineer only uses the internal interface.\n\n1. Customer emails enterprise@github.com (or other test email address), CC'ing a colleague, using markdown formatted text with diagnostics attached as attachment.\n2. Customer & CC receive automatic confirmation email acknowledging receipt and providing information about uploading support bundles.\n3. Ticket received by tool into a form of \"Triage\" queue/view with the correct priority. View indicates attachment and formats markdown as pretty HTML.\n4. Engineer accepts ticket by assigning it to themselves.\n5. Engineer responds to ticket via tool using markdown formatting and includes a different attachment.\n6. Customer & CC receive email from enterprise@github.com (or other test email address) formatted as pretty HTML with attachment.\n7. Perform a bit more back-and-forth over email and confirm all correspondence is received by all parties.\n8. Add a new CC on behalf of the customer and send another update.\n9. Confirm new CC gets update.\n10. If available, @mention or equivalent, another user on the system.\n11. Confirm @mentioned user receives notification of mention.\n12. Customer confirms resolution/closure via email.  If tool supports use of tags in emails to change status, use one to close/resolve the ticket as the customer.\n13. Engineer marks ticket as resolved.\n\n#### Scenario 2: Customer logs a normal priority ticket anonymously (ie without signing in) via web interface.\n\nAs above, but this tests the initial logging of the ticket via a web interface as customers can do now on Zendesk.  All subsequent interaction is via email from the customer and via the internal interface by the engineer.\n\n1. Customer browses to http://public_url_of_tool and submits a ticket, CC'ing a colleague, without signing in first.\n2. Steps 2 to 13 of scenario 1 above.\n\n#### Scenario 3: Customer logs a normal priority ticket via web interface, once signed in.\n\nThis tests the scenario where the customer signs into the web interface offered by the tool being tested and is able to see their previous tickets, create new tickets and close, comment etc on current tickets.  All customer and engineer interactions take place within the web interfaces of the tool.\n\n1. Customer browses to http://public_url_of_tool\n2. Customer signs in or request a password reset in order to gain a login and then signs in.\n3. Customer can view previous tickets from scenarios 1 and 2.\n4. Customer submits a new ticket, CC'ing a colleague.\n5. Steps 2 to 11 of scenario 1 above, but use the customer web interface for interactions from the customer.\n6. Reference ticket in scenario 1 by ID, using format supported by tool, in response to customer and ensure ticket is linked in interface and email received by customer.\n7. Customer references ticket in scenario 2 by ID, using format supported by tool, in response.  Ensure ticket is linked in interface.\n8. Customer marks ticket resolved/closed themselves in web interface.\n9. Engineer confirms ticket is marked as resolved/closed.\n\n#### Scenario 4: Customer logs an Urgent priority ticket via email with a large attachment.\n\nThis tests that customers can log urgent tickets via email without the large attachment blocking the creation of the ticket.\n\n#### Scenarion 5: Customer logs an Urgent priority ticket anonymously (ie without signing in) via web interface.\n\nAs above.\n\n#### Scenarion 6: Customer logs an Urgent priority ticket via web interface, once signed in.\n\nAs above.\n\n#### Scenarion 6: Engineer creates a ticket on behalf of the customer.\n\nThis tests the ability for an engineer to easily create a new ticket on behalf of the customer.\n\n\n### Tools I’ve found to assess so far:\n\n- Zendesk  (we can't discount our currently tools)\n- Halp     ( :point_up: )\n- Groove https://www.groovehq.com/\n- HelpScout http://www.helpscout.net/\n- SupportBee https://supportbee.com\n- Freshdesk http://freshdesk.com/\n- Desk.com http://www.desk.com\n- Happyfox https://www.happyfox.com\n\n## I want you:\n\n![I want you]()\n\nPlease take the time to have a think about...\n\n- what you do and don't like about Zendesk and Halp,\n- what you think we absolutely _must_ have in a replacement tool and why,\n- what you think would be nice to have in a replacement tool and why,\n- usage scenarios for testing a replacement tool,\n- and product names and URLs for a replacement tool that you've used before or know of...\n\n... that I've not listed above and comment on this issue with your thoughts, opinions, options, feedback etc. Please feel free to object to any of my \"must haves\" and \"nice to haves\".\n\nOne thing I like to keep in mind is *\"What would our most pedantic customers (we all know who they are) demand from us with our replacement tool?\"*\n\nIf you've had experiences with any of the above listed or any other tools, then please let me know - I want the good, the bad and the ugly.\n","markerStore":{"nextMarkerId":55,"markersById":{"0":{"range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":0},"end":{"row":0,"column":0}},"properties":{"type":"selection","editorId":4},"reversed":false,"tailed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"never","maintainHistory":true}},"version":2},"history":{"version":2,"nextCheckpointId":2,"undoStack":[],"redoStack":[]},"encoding":"utf8","filePath":"/Users/lildude/Documents/GitHub/New Support Tool Project/ent-sup-survey.md","modifiedWhenLastPersisted":false,"digestWhenLastPersisted":"4dd0472aad503122c176c1fa5eb403c8187d15e3","deserializer":"TextBuffer","version":2}],"deserializer":"Project"},"workspace":{"paneContainer":{"root":{"id":3,"items":[{"id":4,"softTabs":true,"displayBuffer":{"id":5,"softWrapped":true,"scrollTop":395,"scrollLeft":0,"tokenizedBuffer":{"bufferPath":"/Users/lildude/Documents/GitHub/New Support Tool Project/ent-sup-survey.md","largeFileMode":false,"deserializer":"TokenizedBuffer"},"largeFileMode":false,"deserializer":"DisplayBuffer"},"deserializer":"TextEditor"}],"activeItemURI":"/Users/lildude/Documents/GitHub/New Support Tool Project/ent-sup-survey.md","focused":true,"flexScale":1,"deserializer":"Pane"},"activePaneId":3,"deserializer":"PaneContainer","version":1},"fullScreen":false,"packagesWithActiveGrammars":["language-gfm","language-hyperlink","language-todo"],"deserializer":"Workspace"},"packageStates":{"linter":{"scope":"File"},"metrics":{"sessionLength":258157088},"find-and-replace":{"findOptions":{"findPattern":"\\\\n","replacePattern":"\\n","pathsPattern":"","useRegex":true,"wholeWord":false,"caseSensitive":false,"inCurrentSelection":false},"findHistory":["\\\\r\\\\n","\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n","\\\\\\\\n","\\\\n"],"replaceHistory":["\\n"],"pathsHistory":["\\n"]},"fuzzy-finder":{"/Users/lildude/Documents/GitHub/New Support Tool Project/ent-sup-survey.md":1439628587534},"keybinding-resolver":{},"tabs":[{}],"tree-view":{"directoryExpansionStates":{"/Users/lildude/Documents/GitHub/New Support Tool Project":{"isExpanded":true,"entries":{}}},"selectedPath":"/Users/lildude/Documents/GitHub/New Support Tool Project/ent-sup-survey.md","hasFocus":false,"attached":true,"scrollLeft":0,"scrollTop":0,"width":200}}}
