Close and reopen Settings page.\n\n### Basic Settings:\n\n[3ecd2daa]: https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/356 \"Viewing a package's settings should activate it\"\n\n- **siteEngine**: The static engine of your blog.\n- **siteLocalDir**: The path to the directory of your blog.\n- **siteDraftsDir**: The sub-path to your drafts from the `siteLocalDir`. Default is `_draft/`.\n- **sitePostsDir**: The sub-path to your posts from the `siteLocalDir`. Default is `_posts/{year}`. You can use `{year}`, `{month}` and `{day}`.\n- **siteImagesDir**: The sub-path to your images from the `siteLocalDir`. Default is `images/{year}/{month}/`.\n- **newPostFileName**: The filename format of new posts created. Default is `{year}-{month}-{day}-{title}{extension}`.\n- **fileExtension**: The file extension of your posts/drafts. Default is `.markdown`.\n- **urlForTags**: The URL to tags `JSON` file. Refer to next section.\n- **urlForPosts**: The URL to posts `JSON` file. Refer to next section.\n- **urlForCategories**: The URL to categories `JSON` file. Refer to next section.\n\n### Project Specific Settings:\n\nCreate a `_mdwriter.cson` file under your project/blog. See [this commit][02399ed7] for example.\n\n[02399ed7]: https://github.com/zhuochun/zhuochun.github.io/commit/cb34e3c16d42c52b281c34920ad55bbca223ac23 \"zhuochun.github.io\"\n\n### Advance Settings:\n\nTo change these settings, you need to edit in `Atom -> Your Config` file or in your projects' specific setting files.\n\n- **siteLinkPath**: Define path (string) to a `.cson` file that stores all links added for automatic linking next time. Default uses `markdown-writer-links.cson` in Atom's config directory.\n- **frontMatter**: Define front matter (string) used when create new post/draft.\n- **codeblock**: Define fenced code block (object). Default uses GitHub's fenced code block.\n- **imageTag**: Define image tag inserted (string). Default uses `![alt](img-url)`.\n- **projectConfigFile**: Define the project specific `.cson` config file (string). Default uses `_mdwriter.cson`.\n\nThis is an example of advance configuration:\n\n```coffee\n'markdown-writer':\n  # sync the saved links in dropbox\n  'siteLinkPath': '/Users/zhuochun/Dropbox/blog/links.cson'\n  # use Hexo front matter format\n  'frontMatter': \"\"\"\n  layout: <layout>\n  title: \"<title>\"\n  date: \"<date>\"\n  ---\n  \"\"\"\n  # use Jekyll highlight code block\n  # change this requires reload, shift-cmd-P -> Window Reload\n  'codeblock':\n    'before': '{% highlight %}\\n'\n    'after': '\\n{% endhighlight %}'\n    'regexBefore': '{% highlight(?: .+)? %}\\n'\n    'regexAfter': '\\n{% endhighlight %}'\n  # use Octopress img tag\n  'imageTag': \"{% img <align> <src> <width> <height> '{alt}' %}\"\n```\n\n## Setup Tags/Categories/Posts\n\n![Manage Tags](http://i.imgur.com/amt2m0Y.png)\n\nTo **manage tags/categories in front matter** or **search published posts when inserting links**, the Markdown-Writer needs to read `JSON` files that contains the following information of your blog:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tags\": [ \"tag a\", \"tag b\", \"...\" ],\n  \"categories\": [ \"category a\", \"category b\", \"...\" ],\n  \"posts\": [ {\"title\": \"post a\", \"url\": \"url/to/post/a\" } ]\n}\n```\n\nIf you use **Jekyll/Octopress**, download [these scripts](https://gist.github.com/zhuochun/fe127356bcf8c07ae1fb) to your blog, generate and upload your blog again. Setup the full URLs to these files in Settings.\n\nIf you use **Hexo**, you can install [hexo-generator-atom-markdown-writer-meta](https://github.com/timnew/hexo-generator-atom-markdown-writer-meta) (Thanks to [@timnew](https://github.com/timnew)). Generate and upload your blog again. Setup the full URLs to these files in Settings.\n\n## FAQs\n\n#### How to disable default key mappings, e.g. `ctrl-alt-[1-5]`?\n\nGo to `Atom -> Open your Keymap`, paste the following:\n\n```coffee\n'.platform-darwin atom-text-editor':\n  'ctrl-alt-1': 'unset!'\n  'ctrl-alt-2': 'unset!'\n  'ctrl-alt-3': 'unset!'\n  'ctrl-alt-4': 'unset!'\n  'ctrl-alt-5': 'unset!'\n```\n\nDefault mappings can be found in [keymaps/md.cson](https://github.com/zhuochun/md-writer/blob/master/keymaps/keymap.cson).\n\nA list of all commands can also be found [here](https://github.com/zhuochun/md-writer/blob/master/package.json).\n\n## Project\n\n- View [CHANGELOG][e45121fa] :notebook_with_decorative_cover:.\n- Bugs, suggestions & feature requests, [open an issue][e6ad7ed1] :octocat:.\n- License in [MIT][6a9a3773] :unlock:.\n- Authored by [Zhuochun][41ae693b] :sunny:.\n\n[e45121fa]: https://github.com/zhuochun/md-writer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n[e6ad7ed1]: https://github.com/zhuochun/md-writer/issues\n[6a9a3773]: https://github.com/zhuochun/md-writer/blob/master/LICENSE.md\n[41ae693b]: https://github.com/zhuochun\n\n## Tips\n\n- Jumping among your posts: `Cmd-t` or `Cmd-p`.\n- Markdown Preview: [markdown-preview](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview) package.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/zhuochun/md-writer","_id":"markdown-writer@1.1.1","_shasum":"14d0ced65f8934ce808717bece5edf8c354b4ff7","_resolved":"file:../d-11539-2348-18a0aj2/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11539-2348-18a0aj2/package.tgz"}
