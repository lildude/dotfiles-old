See the project at [github](https://github.com/mark-hahn/markdown-scroll-sync).\n\n---\n\n![Image inserted by Atom editor package auto-host-markdown-image](http://i.imgur.com/X3fVXdL.gif)\n\n---\n\n### Usage:\n\nThere is no atom command or keybinding. There are no config settings.\n\nThe package starts on load and watches for when it should sync.  It will automatically sync when there are two panes where one active tab is a markdown file and another active tab is the markdown preview for that file.  At that point it will scroll the preview to match the markdown file's scroll position.  \n\nWhen the markdown file is scrolled the preview is automatically scrolled to match.  If the preview is scrolled then syncing is temporarily turned off until the main file is focused again.  The markdown file is never automatically scrolled to match the preview.\n\n### License\n\nCopyright Mark Hahn by MIT license.\n\n### Advertisement.  \n\nSee other packages by mark-hahn at https://atom.io/users/mark-hahn/packages?direction=desc&sort=downloads.","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mark-hahn/markdown-scroll-sync/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mark-hahn/markdown-scroll-sync","_id":"markdown-scroll-sync@0.3.3","_shasum":"a2da7e4ff4d24a6957110569163ab7fb3cec99f7","_resolved":"file:../d-115416-6200-15pxa4t/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115416-6200-15pxa4t/package.tgz"}
