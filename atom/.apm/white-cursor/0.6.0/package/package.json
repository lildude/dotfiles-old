However, if you set the `white-cursor.enabled` setting to `detect`, then when Atom is loaded or any time you change the themes, the White Cursor package attempts to determine whether you have a dark syntax theme set. If so, it enables the white cursor. You can override its autodetection for the current session by using the `White Cursor: Toggle` command from the Command Palette.\n\n### Commands\n\n* `white-cursor:toggle` &mdash; Toggles the white cursor on or off.\n\n### Configuration\n\n* `white-cursor.enabled` &mdash; Accepts one of three values:\n    * `always` &mdash; White cursor is always enabled **(default)**\n    * `detect` &mdash; Detects whether a dark syntax is being used and enables the white cursor accordingly\n    * `never` &mdash; White cursor is always *disabled*\n* `white-cursor.darkThemes` &mdash; An array of theme package names (lowercased and hyphenated) that should be treated as dark syntax themes even if they do not contain both `dark` and `syntax` in the name\n\n### Styles\n\nThe `.white-cursor-image` mixin is available in case there are situations where you need a white I-bar cursor in some areas of the UI even when you're using a light theme. For example, with the [Term2 package](https://atom.io/packages/term2) you can add the following to your `styles.less`:\n\n```LESS\n@import \"packages/white-cursor/stylesheets/white-cursor\";\n\n.terminal {\n  .white-cursor-image;\n}\n```\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright &copy; 2014-2015 [Lee Dohm](http://www.lee-dohm.com).
